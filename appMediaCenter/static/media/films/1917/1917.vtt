1
00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:31.919
Blake.

2
00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:35.087
Blake.

3
00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:36.922
Sorry, Sarge.

4
00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:38.958
Pick a man.

5
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.760
Bring your kit.

6
00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.695
Yes, Sarge.

7
00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:05.684
Don't dawdle.

8
00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.021
No, Sarge.

9
00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:17.997
Did they feed us?

10
00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.667
No. Just mail.

11
00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:24.637
Time for some tea!

12
00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.107
Tea's up!

13
00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.990
Myrtle's having puppies.

14
00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:47.126
You get anything?

15
00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:49.962
No.

16
00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:53.032
Oh, I'm bloody starving.
Aren't you?

17
00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:56.035
Thought we might get
some decent grub out here.

18
00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:59.006
It was the only reason I
decided against the priesthood.

19
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.045
What you got there?

20
00:03:06.047 --> 00:03:07.880
Ham and bread.

21
00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:10.015
Where did you find that?

22
00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:12.051
I have my uses.

23
00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:14.086
Here.

24
00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.059
Ugh.

25
00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:22.027
Tastes like old shoe.

26
00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.463
Cheer up.

27
00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.732
This time next week,
it'll be chicken dinner.

28
00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:28.968
Not me.

29
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.036
My leave got canceled.

30
00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:33.172
They say why?

31
00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:36.041
No idea.

32
00:03:36.043 --> 00:03:39.078
It's easier
not to go back at all.

33
00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:42.917
Coming through.

34
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.789
Something's up.

35
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.193
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

36
00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:57.763
Has to be the push, right?

37
00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:00.166
Ten bob says we're going up.

38
00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:02.301
I'm not taking that bet.

39
00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:04.203
Why? 'Cause you know I'm right?

40
00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:06.339
No. Because you haven't
got ten bob.

41
00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:13.746
In your own time, gentlemen.

42
00:04:13.748 --> 00:04:15.080
Is there any news, Sarge?

43
00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:17.183
- News of what?
- The big push.

44
00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.817
It was supposed to happen
weeks ago.

45
00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.520
They told us we'd be home
by Christmas.

46
00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:22.288
Yes, well, sorry to
disrupt your crowded schedule,

47
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.823
Blake, but the brass hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.

48
00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:25.991
More's the pity, Sarge.

49
00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:27.159
I could've done with
some turkey.

50
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:28.761
Well, I'll make sure

51
00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:30.896
to relay your displeasure
to command.

52
00:04:30.898 --> 00:04:32.532
So what's on
the cards, then, Sergeant?

53
00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:34.099
The Hun are up to something.

54
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:35.834
Any idea what?

55
00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:38.773
No. But it's
about to ruin our weekend.

56
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.213
Now, listen.

57
00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:51.016
Erinmore is inside,
so tidy yourselves up.

58
00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:52.318
Never know.

59
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.921
Might be mentions in dispatches
for this one.

60
00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:57.858
If you don't bugger it up.

61
00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:03.130
Must be something big
if the general's here.

62
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.943
Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, sir.

63
00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:20.012
Which one of you is Blake?

64
00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:21.847
Sir.

65
00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.984
You have a brother,
a lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?

66
00:05:24.986 --> 00:05:26.051
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:28.120
- Joseph Blake. Is he...
- Alive.

68
00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:30.155
As far as I know.

69
00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:33.125
And with your help,
I'd like to keep it that way.

70
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:35.027
Sanders tells me
you're good with maps.

71
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:36.429
That true?

72
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.998
Good enough, sir.

73
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.001
So...

74
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:44.937
we are here.

75
00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.240
The 2nd Devons
are advancing here.

76
00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:50.343
How long will it take you
to get there?

77
00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.245
I don't understand, sir.

78
00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.180
Sir, that land
is held by the Germans.

79
00:05:55.182 --> 00:05:57.316
Germans have gone.

80
00:05:57.318 --> 00:05:59.251
Don't get your hopes up.

81
00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:02.921
It appears to be
a strategic withdrawal.

82
00:06:02.923 --> 00:06:04.457
They seem to have
created a new line,

83
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.259
nine miles back here
by the looks of it.

84
00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:10.863
Colonel Mackenzie
is in command of the 2nd.

85
00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:12.197
He sent word yesterday morning

86
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.234
he was going after
the retreating Germans.

87
00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:17.437
He is convinced
he has them on the run.

88
00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.305
That if he can
break their lines now,

89
00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:22.207
he will turn the tide.

90
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:23.976
He is wrong.

91
00:06:23.978 --> 00:06:26.979
Colonel Mackenzie
has not seen these aerials

92
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:28.348
of the enemy's new line.

93
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.217
Come around here, gentlemen.

94
00:06:32.253 --> 00:06:35.287
Three miles deep,
field fortifications, defenses,

95
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.091
artillery the like of which
we've never seen before.

96
00:06:39.093 --> 00:06:40.993
The 2nd are due
to attack the line

97
00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:43.195
shortly after dawn tomorrow.

98
00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:45.365
They have no idea
what they're in for.

99
00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:47.199
And we can't warn them.

100
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:51.236
As a parting gift, the enemy
cut all our telephone lines.

101
00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:54.306
Your orders are to get
to the 2nd at Croisilles Wood,

102
00:06:54.308 --> 00:06:57.976
one mile southeast
of the town of Écoust.

103
00:06:57.978 --> 00:06:59.978
Deliver this
to Colonel Mackenzie.

104
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.383
It is a direct order to call
off tomorrow morning's attack.

105
00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:06.285
If you don't,
it will be a massacre.

106
00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:08.220
We will lose two battalions...

107
00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:11.524
1,600 men,
your brother among them.

108
00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:13.992
You think you can
get there in time?

109
00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:15.027
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:16.295
Any questions?

111
00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:18.163
- No, sir.
- Good.

112
00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:20.000
Over to you, Lieutenant.

113
00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:25.204
Supplies, gentlemen.

114
00:07:25.206 --> 00:07:30.142
Map, torches, grenades, and,
uh, a couple of little treats.

115
00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:31.511
Leave immediately.

116
00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.979
Take this trench west
up on Sauchiehall Street,

117
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.148
then northwest on
Paradise Alley at the front.

118
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.118
Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.

119
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.953
Give this note
to Major Stevenson.

120
00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.288
He's holding the line at the
shortest span of no-man's-land.

121
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.290
You'll cross there.

122
00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:46.992
It'll be daylight, sir.
They'll see us.

123
00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:48.328
There's no need
to be concerned.

124
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.297
You should meet no resistance.

125
00:07:57.004 --> 00:08:00.305
Sir, is... is it just us?

126
00:08:00.307 --> 00:08:02.509
"Down to Gehenna
or up to the Throne,

127
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.745
He travels the fastest
who travels alone."

128
00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:07.179
Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?

129
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:08.916
Yes, sir, I would.

130
00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:12.319
Good luck.

131
00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:24.397
Blake, let's talk about this
for a minute.

132
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.366
Why?

133
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.942
Blake.

134
00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:43.081
We just need to think about it.

135
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.249
There's nothing to think about.

136
00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:45.385
It's my big brother.

137
00:08:45.387 --> 00:08:47.219
We should at least
wait until it's dark.

138
00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:48.621
Erinmore said
to leave immediately.

139
00:08:48.623 --> 00:08:51.089
Erinmore's
never seen no-man's-land.

140
00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:52.792
We won't make it ten yards.

141
00:08:52.794 --> 00:08:54.794
- If we just wait...
- You heard him.

142
00:08:54.796 --> 00:08:56.796
He said the Boche have gone.

143
00:08:56.798 --> 00:08:59.264
Is that why
he gave us grenades?

144
00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:06.974
Oy.

145
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.176
Watch where you're going.

146
00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:12.445
Sorry.

147
00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:23.556
All I'm saying is that we wait.

148
00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:27.127
Yes, you would say that, 'cause
it's not your brother, is it?

149
00:09:29.397 --> 00:09:31.631
Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone,

150
00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.266
it didn't end well.

151
00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:36.471
You don't know, Blake.
You weren't there.

152
00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.441
Excuse me. Excuse me.

153
00:09:41.443 --> 00:09:43.010
Excuse me.

154
00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:49.349
You're going up the
down trench, you bloody idiot.

155
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:51.285
Orders of the general, sir.

156
00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.432
All right.
Say the Boche have gone.

157
00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:08.434
Nine miles will take us,
what, six hours?

158
00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.168
Eight at the very most.

159
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.170
So we've got time to wait
until the sun sets.

160
00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:13.606
- It's enemy territory.
- Otherwise, we'll be wide open.

161
00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:15.475
We've got no idea
what we're walking into.

162
00:10:15.477 --> 00:10:18.176
Blake, if we're not
clever about this,

163
00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:20.547
no one will
get to your brother.

164
00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:22.316
I will.

165
00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:26.454
We're here.
This is the front line.

166
00:10:29.123 --> 00:10:31.123
Now we need to find the Yorks.

167
00:11:15.704 --> 00:11:17.470
- Sorry, mate.
- Jesus!

168
00:11:17.472 --> 00:11:18.471
Watch who you're shoving.

169
00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:20.238
All right,
get out of the way, then.

170
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.507
Hey, who the fuck
do you think you are,

171
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:22.508
pushing wounded soldiers
around?!

172
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.776
Let go! Let go of me!

173
00:11:23.778 --> 00:11:25.378
Arsehole knocked down
our sergeant!

174
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.379
The man's fucking wounded!

175
00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:28.381
All right, I'm sorry.
All right? I'm sorry!

176
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:29.582
- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.

177
00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:33.251
- Orders from the general.
- Just let me through.

178
00:11:33.253 --> 00:11:36.188
Get out of the way.

179
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.457
Fine.

180
00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:39.257
Just watch where you're going.

181
00:11:56.444 --> 00:11:57.679
Yorks.

182
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.590
It's bloody quiet.

183
00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:13.326
Was it like this
before Thiepval?

184
00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:15.293
Don't remember.

185
00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:17.262
You don't remember the Somme?

186
00:12:17.264 --> 00:12:18.598
- Not really.
- Hey, mind us.

187
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.300
Come on.

188
00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:24.504
Well, you did all right
out of it.

189
00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:26.839
At least wear your ribbon.

190
00:12:26.841 --> 00:12:29.442
Don't have it anymore.

191
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:31.811
What? You lost your medal?

192
00:12:31.813 --> 00:12:34.514
Heads down, boys.

193
00:12:34.516 --> 00:12:37.317
Come on, lads. Keep digging.

194
00:12:40.722 --> 00:12:42.424
Stay low.

195
00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:50.630
For God's sake. Careful there.

196
00:12:50.632 --> 00:12:52.465
You're stepping on the dead.

197
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.333
That's our sergeant.

198
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:56.636
Be better washing them out of
this dugout with a bloody hose.

199
00:12:56.638 --> 00:12:58.438
Do you know
where the Yorks are?

200
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.372
The next bend,

201
00:12:59.374 --> 00:13:01.273
you'll be standing
on top of half of them.

202
00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:02.809
Shot to hell two nights ago.

203
00:13:11.886 --> 00:13:14.620
- Yorks?
- Yes, Corp.

204
00:13:14.622 --> 00:13:16.456
Where's Major Stevenson?

205
00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:19.492
He was killed,
couple of nights ago, Corporal.

206
00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:21.494
Lieutenant Leslie has command.

207
00:13:21.496 --> 00:13:23.396
Where can we find him?

208
00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:25.398
Next dugout.

209
00:13:32.407 --> 00:13:33.641
Here.

210
00:13:38.747 --> 00:13:40.480
Sir?

211
00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:42.682
- Lieutenant Leslie, sir?
- What is it?

212
00:13:42.684 --> 00:13:44.584
We have a message
from General Erinmore.

213
00:13:44.586 --> 00:13:46.452
- Are you our relief?
- No, sir.

214
00:13:46.454 --> 00:13:48.488
Well, when the fucking hell
are they due?

215
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.890
We don't know, sir, but we've
got orders to cross here.

216
00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:52.692
That is the German front line.

217
00:13:52.694 --> 00:13:54.393
We know, sir.

218
00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:56.364
If you'll just take the letter.

219
00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.833
Settle a bet.
What day is it?

220
00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:02.735
- Friday.
- Friday. Well, well, well.

221
00:14:02.737 --> 00:14:03.903
None of us was right.

222
00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:05.705
This idiot thought
it was Tuesday.

223
00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:08.474
Sorry, sir.

224
00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:10.676
Are they out of
their fucking minds?

225
00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:13.746
One slow night, the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.

226
00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:16.682
Do you think
they're wrong, sir?

227
00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:18.951
We lost an officer
and three men two nights ago.

228
00:14:18.953 --> 00:14:20.820
They were shot to bits
patching up wire.

229
00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:23.723
We dragged two of them
back here. Needn't bothered.

230
00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:26.893
Sir, the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.

231
00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:28.694
There are aerials
of the new line that...

232
00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:29.862
Shut up.
We fought and died

233
00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:31.697
over every inch
of this fucking place.

234
00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:33.366
Now they suddenly
give us miles?

235
00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:35.302
It's a trap.

236
00:14:37.872 --> 00:14:40.139
But chin up. There's a medal
in it, for sure.

237
00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:43.310
Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.

238
00:14:45.747 --> 00:14:47.446
All right.

239
00:14:49.851 --> 00:14:51.651
Where's the nearest
way through, sir?

240
00:14:51.653 --> 00:14:54.687
Our wire's a mess, but there is
a path through of sorts.

241
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:56.823
Rushworth, let him look.

242
00:15:01.763 --> 00:15:03.863
Straight ahead to the left,
past the dead horses.

243
00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:06.732
There's a gap
directly behind them.

244
00:15:06.734 --> 00:15:09.702
Useful, because if it's dark,
you follow the stench.

245
00:15:09.704 --> 00:15:11.604
When you get
to the second wire,

246
00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:13.606
look out for the bowing chap.

247
00:15:13.608 --> 00:15:15.641
There's a small break
just beside him.

248
00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:18.945
The German line is
150-odd yards after that.

249
00:15:18.947 --> 00:15:21.781
Watch out for the craters;
they're deeper than they look.

250
00:15:21.783 --> 00:15:23.883
You fall in,
there's no getting out.

251
00:15:23.885 --> 00:15:24.953
This way.

252
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:28.754
Wake up, Kilgour.

253
00:15:28.756 --> 00:15:30.022
Bloody waste of space.

254
00:15:30.024 --> 00:15:32.425
Any cover, sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?

255
00:15:32.427 --> 00:15:34.594
No, the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.

256
00:15:34.596 --> 00:15:35.862
It was full of bodies anyway.

257
00:15:35.864 --> 00:15:38.566
Your best bet
is to pop over here.

258
00:15:41.603 --> 00:15:44.570
If you do get shot, try to
make it back to the wire.

259
00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:46.505
We won't come after you,
not till it's dark.

260
00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:49.542
And if by some fucking miracle
you do make it,

261
00:15:49.544 --> 00:15:50.676
send up a flare.

262
00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:52.712
Don't have any, sir.

263
00:15:52.714 --> 00:15:54.847
Well, get him one, Kilgour.
Make yourself useful.

264
00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:56.449
Yes, sir.

265
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.020
Through this holy unction,

266
00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:02.722
may the Lord
pardon you your faults

267
00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:04.792
and whatever sins
thou has committed.

268
00:16:07.795 --> 00:16:09.896
I do hate losing these
to the Hun,

269
00:16:09.898 --> 00:16:12.498
so when they start
shooting at you,

270
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.567
could you be so kind
as to throw it back?

271
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:15.937
There's a good chap.

272
00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:20.907
Cheerio.

273
00:16:27.815 --> 00:16:29.882
You sure?

274
00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:31.786
Yes.

275
00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:39.694
Age before beauty.

276
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:28.069
You all right?

277
00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:32.006
Look for cover.

278
00:18:53.895 --> 00:18:55.596
Sap trench.

279
00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:24.750
Stay still.

280
00:20:32.894 --> 00:20:35.828
They're ours.

281
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.932
Keep going. We're halfway.

282
00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:44.265
There's a gap, in the wire.

283
00:22:42.391 --> 00:22:44.326
Sco.

284
00:23:07.948 --> 00:23:10.082
There. That's the front line.

285
00:23:35.377 --> 00:23:37.309
Fuck me.

286
00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:39.013
They really have gone.

287
00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:03.135
Your hand all right?

288
00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:06.406
Put it through
an effing German.

289
00:24:06.408 --> 00:24:08.173
Patch it up.

290
00:24:08.175 --> 00:24:11.378
You'll be wanking again
in no time.

291
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.314
Wrong hand.

292
00:24:43.244 --> 00:24:45.244
They're not long gone.

293
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:09.970
No good.

294
00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:34.059
Blocked.

295
00:25:34.061 --> 00:25:35.996
This might be a way through.

296
00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:52.980
Jesus.

297
00:26:01.121 --> 00:26:03.556
Look at this.

298
00:26:03.558 --> 00:26:05.259
It's massive.

299
00:26:08.229 --> 00:26:10.164
They built all this.

300
00:26:56.444 --> 00:26:58.310
Here's our way through.

301
00:26:58.312 --> 00:27:00.613
Sco.

302
00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:02.247
How about this?

303
00:27:07.121 --> 00:27:08.456
Bloody hell.

304
00:27:11.393 --> 00:27:13.328
Even their rats
are bigger than ours.

305
00:27:20.402 --> 00:27:23.369
What do you think's
in the bags?

306
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:25.340
You cannot be that hungry.

307
00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:35.314
Look at him,
cocky little bastard.

308
00:27:35.316 --> 00:27:37.215
You could eat this, though.

309
00:27:37.217 --> 00:27:39.454
- What is it?
- Boche dog meat.

310
00:27:41.489 --> 00:27:43.458
What's in the other boxes?

311
00:27:45.493 --> 00:27:48.595
- What's wrong?
- Trip wire.

312
00:27:48.597 --> 00:27:50.763
Don't move.

313
00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:52.534
Where is it?

314
00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:56.538
Goes from here to the door.

315
00:27:59.341 --> 00:28:00.506
Oh, Jesus!

316
00:28:00.508 --> 00:28:02.109
Oh, no.

317
00:28:12.252 --> 00:28:13.453
Sco!

318
00:28:19.527 --> 00:28:21.527
Sco?

319
00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:26.666
Sco!

320
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.303
Sco! Sco.

321
00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:41.246
Sco! Sco.

322
00:28:43.418 --> 00:28:44.651
Sco.

323
00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:47.453
Sco! Wake up!

324
00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:48.621
Wake up!

325
00:28:50.992 --> 00:28:52.525
Sco! Sco!

326
00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:57.295
Stand up! Stand up!

327
00:28:57.297 --> 00:28:59.832
Come on. Stand up!

328
00:28:59.834 --> 00:29:03.403
Up! Up! Up!

329
00:29:03.405 --> 00:29:04.704
Come on!

330
00:29:04.706 --> 00:29:07.373
Stand up!

331
00:29:10.512 --> 00:29:11.811
The whole thing's coming down!

332
00:29:11.813 --> 00:29:13.646
Come on.

333
00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:20.653
You keep hold of me!

334
00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:35.635
We need to keep moving!

335
00:29:35.637 --> 00:29:37.036
Come on!

336
00:29:37.038 --> 00:29:40.305
I can't see. I can't see!

337
00:29:40.307 --> 00:29:42.341
Oh! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

338
00:29:42.343 --> 00:29:43.543
Stop!

339
00:29:43.545 --> 00:29:45.778
It's a mine shaft!

340
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.847
Right, we'll have to jump.

341
00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:49.216
Come on!

342
00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:53.553
You're going to have to jump.

343
00:29:53.555 --> 00:29:55.320
- Just jump!
- I can't.

344
00:29:55.322 --> 00:29:57.557
- I can't see!
- You need to trust me.

345
00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:00.460
Jump!

346
00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:08.403
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go!

347
00:30:11.573 --> 00:30:13.840
Light. There's light.

348
00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:28.454
Stop. Stop.

349
00:30:28.456 --> 00:30:29.722
Just let me stand.

350
00:30:32.827 --> 00:30:34.796
Dirty bastards!

351
00:30:41.402 --> 00:30:44.403
Careful. They may have
left other traps.

352
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.448
Jesus.

353
00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:05.691
Dust.

354
00:31:05.693 --> 00:31:07.760
So much dust in my eyes.

355
00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:18.137
Here.

356
00:31:18.139 --> 00:31:20.307
Have some of mine.

357
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.781
I wish I'd shot that rat now.

358
00:31:28.783 --> 00:31:31.784
I wish you picked
some other bloody idiot.

359
00:31:31.786 --> 00:31:35.388
- What?
- Why in God's name did you have to choose me?

360
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.523
Well, I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

361
00:31:37.525 --> 00:31:38.925
No, you didn't.

362
00:31:38.927 --> 00:31:41.629
You never know.
That's your problem.

363
00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:47.533
All right, then, go back.

364
00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:48.734
Nothing's stopping you.

365
00:31:48.736 --> 00:31:51.704
- You can go all the way bloody home if you want.
- Don't.

366
00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:54.674
Just don't.

367
00:31:54.676 --> 00:31:56.876
I-I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

368
00:31:56.878 --> 00:31:59.579
I thought they were going to
send us back up the line

369
00:31:59.581 --> 00:32:01.948
or for food or something.

370
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.617
I thought it was going to be
something easy.

371
00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:07.186
All right?

372
00:32:07.188 --> 00:32:09.357
I never thought
it would be this.

373
00:32:15.797 --> 00:32:17.565
So do you want to go back?

374
00:32:21.636 --> 00:32:23.571
Just fire the fucking flare.

375
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.921
Up yours, Lieutenant.

376
00:32:56.037 --> 00:32:58.406
Do you know where we are?

377
00:33:00.742 --> 00:33:03.876
Écoust is directly southeast.

378
00:33:03.878 --> 00:33:08.449
And if we keep that bearing,
we should make it.

379
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.920
Come on, then.

380
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.579
Look at that.

381
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:43.549
They destroyed their own guns.

382
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:46.752
They destroyed
their own trenches, too.

383
00:33:46.754 --> 00:33:48.688
What do you mean?

384
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.990
I think they wanted us
to go that way.

385
00:33:50.992 --> 00:33:52.961
They wanted to bury us.

386
00:33:59.934 --> 00:34:02.503
You bastard rats.

387
00:34:09.143 --> 00:34:10.876
Hey.

388
00:34:10.878 --> 00:34:13.112
Did you hear that story
about Wilko?

389
00:34:13.114 --> 00:34:15.982
- How he lost his ear.
- I'm not in the mood.

390
00:34:15.984 --> 00:34:17.750
Keep your eyes on the trees.

391
00:34:17.752 --> 00:34:19.721
Top of the ridge.

392
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.525
Bet he told you
it was shrapnel.

393
00:34:26.094 --> 00:34:28.728
What was it, then?

394
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.798
Well, you know his girl's
a hairdresser, right?

395
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.134
And he was moaning about
the lack of bathing facilities

396
00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:37.337
when he wrote to her.

397
00:34:37.339 --> 00:34:39.071
Remember those
rancid jakes at Arras?

398
00:34:39.073 --> 00:34:40.706
Yeah.

399
00:34:40.708 --> 00:34:45.011
Anyway, she sends him over
this hair oil.

400
00:34:45.013 --> 00:34:48.016
Smells sweet.
Like Golden Syrup.

401
00:34:50.051 --> 00:34:52.985
Wilko loves the smell,

402
00:34:52.987 --> 00:34:56.655
but he doesn't want
to cart it around in his pack.

403
00:34:56.657 --> 00:35:02.128
So he slathers it all over
his barnet, goes to sleep.

404
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.997
And in the middle of the night,
he wakes up,

405
00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:08.901
and a rat is sitting
on his shoulder,

406
00:35:08.903 --> 00:35:11.203
licking the oil off his head.

407
00:35:11.205 --> 00:35:14.040
Wilko panics, and he jumps up.

408
00:35:14.042 --> 00:35:17.743
And when he does, the rat bites
clean through his fucking ear

409
00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:19.812
- and runs off with it.
- No.

410
00:35:19.814 --> 00:35:22.014
Oh, he made a hell of a fuss...

411
00:35:22.016 --> 00:35:24.650
yelling, screaming.

412
00:35:24.652 --> 00:35:27.987
The best of it was he put
so much bloody oil on himself

413
00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:29.722
that he couldn't wash it off.

414
00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:30.990
He was like a magnet.

415
00:35:30.992 --> 00:35:32.725
The rats left us alone,

416
00:35:32.727 --> 00:35:34.660
but they couldn't get
enough of him.

417
00:35:34.662 --> 00:35:36.662
Poor bastard.

418
00:35:43.037 --> 00:35:45.704
Heading back home.

419
00:35:45.706 --> 00:35:49.175
I wonder what they saw.

420
00:35:49.177 --> 00:35:51.112
Watch the ridgelines.

421
00:35:55.817 --> 00:35:58.984
Well, that's your medal
sorted, then.

422
00:35:58.986 --> 00:36:00.986
What do you mean?

423
00:36:00.988 --> 00:36:02.955
"Lance Corporal Blake
showed unusual valor

424
00:36:02.957 --> 00:36:05.658
rescuing a comrade
from certain death."

425
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.428
Blah, blah, blah.

426
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.663
You reckon?

427
00:36:10.665 --> 00:36:11.999
I do.

428
00:36:14.702 --> 00:36:16.135
Well, that'd be nice.

429
00:36:16.137 --> 00:36:18.003
Since you lost yours.

430
00:36:18.005 --> 00:36:20.973
I didn't lose mine.

431
00:36:20.975 --> 00:36:22.842
What happened to it, then?

432
00:36:22.844 --> 00:36:25.780
- Why do you care?
- Why do you not?

433
00:36:27.849 --> 00:36:30.082
I swapped it
with a French captain.

434
00:36:30.084 --> 00:36:32.084
- Swapped it?
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.819
For what?

436
00:36:33.821 --> 00:36:35.955
Bottle of wine.

437
00:36:35.957 --> 00:36:37.857
Well, what did you do that for?

438
00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:39.060
I was thirsty.

439
00:36:40.995 --> 00:36:42.763
What a waste.

440
00:36:44.799 --> 00:36:46.765
You should've
taken it home with you.

441
00:36:46.767 --> 00:36:49.237
You should've given it
to your family.

442
00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:54.206
Men have died for that.

443
00:36:54.208 --> 00:36:56.476
If I got a medal,
I'd take it back home.

444
00:36:56.478 --> 00:36:58.010
Why didn't you just
take it home?

445
00:36:58.012 --> 00:37:00.112
Look, it's just
a bit of bloody tin.

446
00:37:00.114 --> 00:37:01.947
It doesn't make you special.

447
00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:04.950
Doesn't make
any difference to anyone.

448
00:37:04.952 --> 00:37:06.986
Yes, it does.

449
00:37:06.988 --> 00:37:08.888
And it's not just a bit of tin.

450
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.092
It's got a ribbon on it.

451
00:37:15.196 --> 00:37:17.196
I hated going home.

452
00:37:17.198 --> 00:37:19.066
I hated it.

453
00:37:21.102 --> 00:37:23.969
When I knew I couldn't stay,

454
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:26.941
when I knew I had to leave
and they might never see...

455
00:37:57.972 --> 00:37:59.207
Jesus.

456
00:38:02.143 --> 00:38:04.111
They chopped them all down.

457
00:38:08.015 --> 00:38:09.717
Cherries.

458
00:38:13.087 --> 00:38:14.889
Lamberts.

459
00:38:17.992 --> 00:38:20.059
They might be dukes.

460
00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:22.995
Hard to tell
when they aren't in fruit.

461
00:38:22.997 --> 00:38:25.264
What's the difference?

462
00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:28.133
Well, people think
there's one type.

463
00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:29.802
But there's lots of them.

464
00:38:29.804 --> 00:38:32.071
Cuthberts, Queen Annes,
Montmorencys,

465
00:38:32.073 --> 00:38:33.973
sweet ones, sour ones.

466
00:38:33.975 --> 00:38:36.343
Why on earth
would you know this?

467
00:38:36.345 --> 00:38:39.011
Mum's got an orchard back home.

468
00:38:39.013 --> 00:38:41.348
Only a few trees.

469
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.817
This time of year, it looks
like it's been snowing.

470
00:38:44.819 --> 00:38:47.420
Blossom everywhere.

471
00:38:47.422 --> 00:38:51.023
And then in May,
we have to pick them.

472
00:38:51.025 --> 00:38:52.260
Me and Joe.

473
00:38:54.295 --> 00:38:56.862
Takes the whole day.

474
00:38:56.864 --> 00:38:59.231
So these ones are all goners?

475
00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.966
Oh, no.

476
00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:03.302
They'll grow again
when the stones rot.

477
00:39:03.304 --> 00:39:05.239
You'll end up with
more trees than before.

478
00:39:11.145 --> 00:39:12.945
It looks abandoned.

479
00:39:12.947 --> 00:39:15.180
Let's hope so.

480
00:39:15.182 --> 00:39:17.051
We have to make sure.

481
00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:51.420
I'll take front. You take back.

482
00:40:34.128 --> 00:40:36.128
Anything?

483
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.865
Nothing.

484
00:40:56.117 --> 00:40:58.353
- Did you find any food?
- No.

485
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:02.156
I don't like this place.

486
00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:13.460
Map says get over that ridge,

487
00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:17.095
and it's a straight shot
to Écoust.

488
00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:18.567
Good.

489
00:43:02.477 --> 00:43:05.143
Is that our friends again?

490
00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:07.447
Looks like it.

491
00:43:07.449 --> 00:43:10.249
Dogfight.

492
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:12.284
Who's winning?

493
00:43:12.286 --> 00:43:14.420
Us, I think.

494
00:43:14.422 --> 00:43:16.156
Two on one.

495
00:43:19.427 --> 00:43:21.363
They got him.

496
00:44:19.186 --> 00:44:20.720
We should put him
out of his misery.

497
00:44:20.722 --> 00:44:22.657
No. Get him some water.
He needs water.

498
00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:27.225
It's all right.
It's all right. Steady.

499
00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:30.197
- St-Steady. Stay still.
- <i>Nein.</i>

500
00:44:38.373 --> 00:44:40.640
Stop. Stop!

501
00:44:40.642 --> 00:44:42.575
No, no, no!

502
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:48.481
No!

503
00:44:48.483 --> 00:44:50.215
You bastard!

504
00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:53.553
You bloody bastard.

505
00:44:56.958 --> 00:44:58.391
Oh.

506
00:44:58.393 --> 00:44:59.626
- Oh, God, no.
- Oh.

507
00:44:59.628 --> 00:45:01.226
My God, no!

508
00:45:02.597 --> 00:45:05.365
Jes... Jesus, no!

509
00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:07.265
- Oh, Je...
- We have to stop the bleeding.

510
00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:09.402
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

511
00:45:09.404 --> 00:45:11.404
It's all right. It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

512
00:45:11.406 --> 00:45:12.605
Ow.

513
00:45:12.607 --> 00:45:14.474
We're going to stand up.

514
00:45:14.476 --> 00:45:16.376
- Yes. Yes.
- Right?

515
00:45:16.378 --> 00:45:18.312
Okay.

516
00:45:20.515 --> 00:45:22.348
No! I can't. I can't.

517
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.417
Ow!

518
00:45:24.419 --> 00:45:26.552
- We have to get to an aid post.
- I can't!

519
00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:28.253
I'll carry you.
It isn't very far.

520
00:45:28.255 --> 00:45:29.622
Just bring a doctor here.

521
00:45:29.624 --> 00:45:31.557
We can't.
We have to go together.

522
00:45:33.227 --> 00:45:36.329
We're going to get up.
We're going to get up.

523
00:45:42.404 --> 00:45:44.236
Stop.

524
00:45:44.238 --> 00:45:45.705
Please stop!

525
00:45:45.707 --> 00:45:47.006
Put me down!

526
00:45:47.008 --> 00:45:48.574
Put me down, you bastard!

527
00:45:48.576 --> 00:45:50.610
Please! Put me down!

528
00:46:01.288 --> 00:46:02.855
You have to try to keep moving.

529
00:46:02.857 --> 00:46:04.557
Let's just sit.

530
00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:06.426
- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.

531
00:46:06.428 --> 00:46:08.361
We have to find the 2nd,
remember?

532
00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:09.729
Your brother.
We have to go now.

533
00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:11.664
You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.

534
00:46:11.666 --> 00:46:12.665
No.

535
00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:14.634
You can't stay here.

536
00:46:14.636 --> 00:46:16.769
We have to move.
All right?

537
00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:18.404
We have to move.

538
00:46:18.406 --> 00:46:20.305
Come on. Come on!

539
00:46:20.307 --> 00:46:22.341
Come on.

540
00:46:22.343 --> 00:46:24.276
That's it. Come on.

541
00:46:24.278 --> 00:46:27.647
Come on. Come on.

542
00:46:31.853 --> 00:46:33.352
Your brother.

543
00:46:33.354 --> 00:46:35.354
We have to find your brother.

544
00:46:37.625 --> 00:46:40.626
You'll recognize him.

545
00:46:40.628 --> 00:46:42.595
He looks like me.

546
00:46:42.597 --> 00:46:45.064
And he's a bit older.

547
00:46:57.846 --> 00:46:59.647
What are they?

548
00:47:01.716 --> 00:47:04.717
Are we being shelled?

549
00:47:04.719 --> 00:47:06.352
They're embers.

550
00:47:06.354 --> 00:47:08.288
The barn is on fire.

551
00:47:12.393 --> 00:47:13.728
I've been hit.

552
00:47:15.797 --> 00:47:18.531
What was it?

553
00:47:18.533 --> 00:47:20.267
You were stabbed.

554
00:47:25.707 --> 00:47:27.675
Am I dying?

555
00:47:35.884 --> 00:47:38.818
Yes.

556
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.755
Yes, I think you are.

557
00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:48.494
Oh. No. No.

558
00:47:57.672 --> 00:47:59.138
This?

559
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.773
Inside.

560
00:48:24.566 --> 00:48:27.934
Will you write
to my mum for me?

561
00:48:27.936 --> 00:48:29.637
I will.

562
00:48:32.473 --> 00:48:34.473
Tell her I wasn't scared.

563
00:48:37.979 --> 00:48:40.179
Anything else?

564
00:48:41.983 --> 00:48:43.818
I love them.

565
00:48:45.887 --> 00:48:47.655
I wish that...

566
00:48:49.724 --> 00:48:51.659
I wish that...

567
00:48:57.198 --> 00:48:58.766
Talk to me.

568
00:49:01.002 --> 00:49:02.937
Tell me you know the way.

569
00:49:06.541 --> 00:49:09.542
I know the way.

570
00:49:09.544 --> 00:49:12.912
I'm going to head southeast
until I hit Écoust.

571
00:49:12.914 --> 00:49:15.882
I'll pass through the town
and out to the east,

572
00:49:15.884 --> 00:49:18.584
all the way to Croisilles Wood.

573
00:49:18.586 --> 00:49:21.053
It'll be dark by then.

574
00:49:21.055 --> 00:49:23.689
That won't bother me.

575
00:49:23.691 --> 00:49:25.691
I'll find the 2nd,

576
00:49:25.693 --> 00:49:27.760
I'll give them the message,

577
00:49:27.762 --> 00:49:30.029
and then I'll find
your brother.

578
00:49:30.031 --> 00:49:31.831
Just like you.

579
00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:33.801
A little older.

580
00:51:36.024 --> 00:51:38.924
You all right, mate?

581
00:51:38.926 --> 00:51:41.861
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay.

582
00:51:41.863 --> 00:51:43.698
Come on, help him.

583
00:51:52.774 --> 00:51:56.942
Jesus. What happened to him?

584
00:51:56.944 --> 00:51:58.677
Was it the plane?

585
00:51:58.679 --> 00:52:00.882
- We saw the smoke.
- Yeah.

586
00:52:17.932 --> 00:52:19.799
Go and fetch his things.

587
00:52:19.801 --> 00:52:21.636
- Sir.
- Sir.

588
00:52:25.073 --> 00:52:26.774
A friend?

589
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.844
What are you doing here?

590
00:52:31.846 --> 00:52:34.680
I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.

591
00:52:34.682 --> 00:52:37.083
Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.

592
00:52:37.085 --> 00:52:38.984
And where are they stationed?

593
00:52:38.986 --> 00:52:41.421
Just beyond Écoust.

594
00:52:41.423 --> 00:52:42.990
Come with me.

595
00:52:49.097 --> 00:52:51.864
Come with me, Corporal.
It's an order.

596
00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:52.998
We're passing through Écoust.

597
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.936
We can take you
some of the way.

598
00:52:56.871 --> 00:52:58.072
Sir.

599
00:53:23.131 --> 00:53:24.864
Oh, come on, Sergeant!

600
00:53:24.866 --> 00:53:27.133
Put more men on the base.

601
00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:29.969
At the trunk.
It'll be heavier there.

602
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:31.837
Might be a tight squeeze.

603
00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:34.173
No, you're not going
to be able to just lift it.

604
00:53:34.175 --> 00:53:36.775
Pivot the front end
to the left.

605
00:53:36.777 --> 00:53:39.078
Jesus, they don't
make things easy, do they?

606
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.914
They could at least have
retreated with a bit of grace.

607
00:53:41.916 --> 00:53:43.015
Bastards!

608
00:53:43.017 --> 00:53:44.783
Sir.

609
00:53:44.785 --> 00:53:46.785
- You're not one of mine.
- No, sir.

610
00:53:46.787 --> 00:53:49.255
He has an urgent message to
deliver to the 2nd Devons, sir.

611
00:53:49.257 --> 00:53:50.856
Can you get past it?

612
00:53:50.858 --> 00:53:52.325
- No, sir.
- Oh, for God's sake.

613
00:53:52.327 --> 00:53:54.793
Just move it!

614
00:53:54.795 --> 00:53:57.296
There's room
in the casuals' truck, sir.

615
00:53:57.298 --> 00:53:59.798
- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, all right.

616
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.801
Come on, now. You can
get through there sideways.

617
00:54:07.041 --> 00:54:09.041
How did you get here, sir?

618
00:54:09.043 --> 00:54:12.811
Crossed no-man's-land,
just outside Bapaume.

619
00:54:12.813 --> 00:54:14.280
Took us the whole night.

620
00:54:14.282 --> 00:54:16.782
Bumped into a couple of
Hun stragglers on the way

621
00:54:16.784 --> 00:54:18.984
who made a nuisance
of themselves.

622
00:54:18.986 --> 00:54:20.819
You're going up
to the new line?

623
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:22.288
Attempting to.

624
00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:24.023
The Newfoundlands
have pushed forwards

625
00:54:24.025 --> 00:54:25.960
and requested reinforcements.

626
00:54:28.029 --> 00:54:31.096
I'm sorry about your friend.

627
00:54:31.098 --> 00:54:33.935
May I tell you something
that you probably already know?

628
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:38.971
It doesn't do to dwell on it.

629
00:54:38.973 --> 00:54:40.940
No, sir.

630
00:54:40.942 --> 00:54:42.208
Hop on.

631
00:54:44.045 --> 00:54:45.880
Make some space there.

632
00:54:47.848 --> 00:54:49.915
Come on, in you get.

633
00:55:05.866 --> 00:55:08.736
All right.
Here we go again, boys.

634
00:55:11.138 --> 00:55:14.742
Welcome aboard the night bus
to fuck-knows-where.

635
00:55:18.079 --> 00:55:21.247
Is that a dead dog?

636
00:55:21.249 --> 00:55:23.249
- You got a fag?
- Yeah. There you go.

637
00:55:39.934 --> 00:55:41.300
- Butler.
- Oy.

638
00:55:41.302 --> 00:55:44.103
- Carry on with that story.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

639
00:55:44.105 --> 00:55:48.240
So, when we get off the train,
Beaufoy comes up to us,

640
00:55:48.242 --> 00:55:50.909
and he's having a right go.

641
00:55:50.911 --> 00:55:52.878
"Lance Corporal,
whatever one does,

642
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.347
one never lets standards slip."

643
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:56.215
Then Scott comes
out the latrine.

644
00:55:56.217 --> 00:55:58.984
He wipes his hand on the back
of Beaufoy's jacket.

645
00:55:58.986 --> 00:56:01.253
Shit all down his back.

646
00:56:01.255 --> 00:56:02.955
Was that meant to be
Captain Beaufoy?

647
00:56:02.957 --> 00:56:06.025
Oh, piss off, you.
You can't do any better.

648
00:56:06.027 --> 00:56:07.627
"Men, your rifle stocks are

649
00:56:07.629 --> 00:56:10.195
an embarrassment to the entire
Expeditionary Force."

650
00:56:10.197 --> 00:56:11.464
- Nah.
- No.

651
00:56:11.466 --> 00:56:13.265
You're both bloody awful.

652
00:56:13.267 --> 00:56:15.934
You don't know. You barely even
speak the bloody language.

653
00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:17.936
He's got a better grasp
of it than you, Cooke.

654
00:56:17.938 --> 00:56:19.972
Well, go on, then, Jondalar.
Give it a go. Let's see it.

655
00:56:22.209 --> 00:56:26.011
"Rossi! Never in my 200 years
as a soldier

656
00:56:26.013 --> 00:56:28.448
have I seen such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit."

657
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:30.215
Shite.

658
00:56:30.217 --> 00:56:32.419
That is total shit.

659
00:56:32.421 --> 00:56:34.454
Oy. Could've taken
my teeth out with that.

660
00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:36.391
You could do with a new set.

661
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:44.464
You got somewhere
you need to be?

662
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.233
- No.
- Arsehole needs driving lessons.

663
00:57:04.051 --> 00:57:07.319
- He should reverse.
- Yeah.

664
00:57:07.321 --> 00:57:09.389
Try it in reverse.

665
00:57:09.391 --> 00:57:11.123
Reverse!

666
00:57:18.265 --> 00:57:19.332
No. Stop.

667
00:57:19.334 --> 00:57:21.166
Stop!

668
00:57:21.168 --> 00:57:23.436
- Everyone needs to get out.
- Who the fuck is he?

669
00:57:23.438 --> 00:57:26.339
All out!

670
00:57:26.341 --> 00:57:27.973
- Come on!
- All right.

671
00:57:27.975 --> 00:57:30.976
All right,
keep your bloody hair on.

672
00:57:30.978 --> 00:57:32.379
Right.

673
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:35.214
One, two, three!

674
00:57:42.022 --> 00:57:44.189
We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.

675
00:57:44.191 --> 00:57:45.392
No, we haven't got the time.

676
00:57:45.394 --> 00:57:47.427
We all need to push.
Come on.

677
00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:48.994
Come on!

678
00:57:55.302 --> 00:57:57.537
Please. I have to go now.

679
00:57:57.539 --> 00:58:00.440
Please.

680
00:58:00.442 --> 00:58:02.174
All right, come on, lads.

681
00:58:02.176 --> 00:58:03.175
Come on.

682
00:58:03.177 --> 00:58:04.276
Come on, boys.

683
00:58:04.278 --> 00:58:07.279
One, two, three.

684
00:58:18.292 --> 00:58:20.460
Come on, boys!
One last push, yeah?!

685
00:58:20.462 --> 00:58:23.262
One, two, three!

686
00:58:35.544 --> 00:58:37.176
Back in.

687
00:58:37.178 --> 00:58:38.545
Get back in.

688
00:58:38.547 --> 00:58:40.480
Go.

689
00:58:40.482 --> 00:58:42.549
Are you all right?

690
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:44.316
Here, driver, how about you try

691
00:58:44.318 --> 00:58:46.486
to keep it on the bloody road
for a change?

692
00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:48.220
Oh, piss off.

693
00:59:07.107 --> 00:59:10.209
So, where are you going?

694
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:14.046
I have to get to the
2nd Devons, just past Écoust.

695
00:59:14.048 --> 00:59:16.215
Why?

696
00:59:16.217 --> 00:59:17.817
They're attacking at dawn.

697
00:59:17.819 --> 00:59:19.519
I have orders to stop them.

698
00:59:19.521 --> 00:59:22.154
How come?

699
00:59:22.156 --> 00:59:24.122
They're walking into a trap.

700
00:59:24.124 --> 00:59:26.124
How many?

701
00:59:26.126 --> 00:59:27.327
Sixteen hundred.

702
00:59:27.329 --> 00:59:29.294
Ooh.

703
00:59:29.296 --> 00:59:30.998
Jesus.

704
00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:36.168
Why did they send you
on your own?

705
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.570
They didn't.

706
00:59:37.572 --> 00:59:40.305
There were two of us.

707
00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:42.475
So now it's down to you?

708
00:59:42.477 --> 00:59:45.143
Yes.

709
00:59:45.145 --> 00:59:47.081
You'll never make it.

710
00:59:50.552 --> 00:59:52.487
Yes, I will.

711
00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.560
Thank you.

712
01:00:02.597 --> 01:00:04.564
Look at it.

713
01:00:04.566 --> 01:00:07.367
Fucking look at it.

714
01:00:07.369 --> 01:00:10.235
Three years fighting over this.

715
01:00:10.237 --> 01:00:13.205
We should've just let
the bastards keep it.

716
01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:15.140
I mean, who machine-guns cows?

717
01:00:15.142 --> 01:00:17.377
Huns with extra bullets.

718
01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:19.445
Bastards.

719
01:00:19.447 --> 01:00:21.280
Clever.

720
01:00:21.282 --> 01:00:25.585
They know if they don't shoot
the cow, you will eat it.

721
01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:27.286
Still bastards.

722
01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:29.689
Yeah, it's not even
our bloody country.

723
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:31.624
How long gone
do you reckon they are?

724
01:00:31.626 --> 01:00:33.158
Why?

725
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.527
Worried we'll catch up
with them?

726
01:00:34.529 --> 01:00:36.161
Yeah.

727
01:00:36.163 --> 01:00:38.364
Right. Be a bloody miracle
at this rate.

728
01:00:38.366 --> 01:00:40.600
Yeah, they're probably
right round the next corner.

729
01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:43.436
Piss off. No, they're not.

730
01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:46.138
Why don't they just
bloody well give up?

731
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.741
Eh? Don't they want to go home?

732
01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:51.209
They hate
their wives and mothers.

733
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:53.211
And Germany must be a shithole.

734
01:00:55.215 --> 01:00:56.583
They're retreating.

735
01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:58.418
They're miles back.

736
01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.219
Got 'em on the ropes, at least.

737
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:04.591
No. We don't.

738
01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:08.226
Oh, bollocks.
What's up now?

739
01:01:08.228 --> 01:01:09.762
Not another bloody tree.

740
01:01:09.764 --> 01:01:11.364
Bridge is down.

741
01:01:11.366 --> 01:01:13.600
Oh. That's a shame.

742
01:01:13.602 --> 01:01:15.635
Looks like I'll be
getting out here.

743
01:01:15.637 --> 01:01:17.537
Good luck.

744
01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:19.372
Keep some of that luck
for yourself, pal.

745
01:01:19.374 --> 01:01:21.239
- Think you'll be needing it.
- Good luck, mate.

746
01:01:21.241 --> 01:01:22.508
- Good luck.
- Good luck, gov.

747
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.644
- Good luck.
- Don't balls it up.

748
01:01:24.646 --> 01:01:27.547
I hope you get there.

749
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:29.249
Thank you.

750
01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:34.286
The next bridge is six miles.

751
01:01:34.288 --> 01:01:35.655
We'll have to divert.

752
01:01:35.657 --> 01:01:37.357
I can't, sir.

753
01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.291
I don't have the time.

754
01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:42.294
Of course.

755
01:01:42.296 --> 01:01:44.364
Best of luck.

758
01:01:51.339 --> 01:01:55.273
If you do manage to get
to Colonel Mackenzie,

759
01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:57.744
make sure there are witnesses.

760
01:01:57.746 --> 01:01:59.445
They are direct orders, sir.

761
01:01:59.447 --> 01:02:01.714
I know.

762
01:02:01.716 --> 01:02:04.350
But some men
just want the fight.

763
01:02:06.588 --> 01:02:08.288
Thank you, sir.

764

D Company, move out!

852
01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.443
You all right, pal?

853
01:32:30.445 --> 01:32:32.077
Uh, where you from?

854
01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.346
He's probably got the wind up.

855
01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:34.481
Well, he's not one of ours.

856
01:32:34.483 --> 01:32:36.382
He's bloody soaked.

857
01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:39.218
Fuck it. Let's just pick
him up and take him with us.

858
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.621
Have to find the Devons.

859
01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:44.524
- What's he saying?
- What's that, mate?

860
01:32:44.526 --> 01:32:46.659
The Devons.

861
01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:50.330
I have to find the Devons.

862
01:32:50.332 --> 01:32:52.332
We're the Devons.

863
01:32:55.604 --> 01:32:58.138
- You're the Devons?
- Yes, Corp.

864
01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:01.608
Why haven't you gone over?

865
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:03.275
W-We're the second wave.

866
01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:05.110
They don't send us all at once.

867
01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:08.113
Yeah, we're D Company.
We spent the night digging in.

868
01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.616
We go last.

869
01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:13.085
Are you all right?

870
01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.455
Mackenzie.
Where's Colonel Mackenzie?

871
01:33:15.457 --> 01:33:17.557
Well, he's down at the line.

872
01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:19.191
- Which way?
- This way.

873
01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.293
We're headed up there now.

874
01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:23.295
Oy, steady on, mate.
Where you going?

875
01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.186
Move!

876
01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.426
Let me by!

877
01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.629
Let me through!

878
01:33:56.631 --> 01:34:00.900
Remember, follow
your platoon commander.

879
01:34:00.902 --> 01:34:03.636
Stay spread out
and watch for his orders.

880
01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.438
Where is
your commanding officer?

881
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.239
He's in the holding pen.

882
01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:10.710
Raise your signal
flags or fire the signal flares

883
01:34:10.712 --> 01:34:13.346
when you've taken your section
of the Hun line.

884
01:34:13.348 --> 01:34:14.614
B Company, stand to.

885
01:34:14.616 --> 01:34:16.516
Now, listen and listen well.

886
01:34:16.518 --> 01:34:18.585
On the first mark,
A Company will advance.

887
01:34:18.587 --> 01:34:20.753
B Company will then move
to the front line.

888
01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:22.922
Sir, I have a message
from General Erinmore.

889
01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:24.289
Who the fuck are you?

890
01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:25.658
The attack has been called off.

891
01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.627
General Erinmore has
called off the attack.

892
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:29.629
Balls, man.
We're about to go over.

893
01:34:29.631 --> 01:34:31.364
- We've got them on the run.
- You don't.

894
01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:32.498
Please don't
send your men over.

895
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.766
Get out of the way, Corporal!

896
01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:35.401
These are direct orders
from army command!

897
01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:36.636
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?!

898
01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:39.539
Jesus Christ, man!
Go and see the captain!

899
01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:41.641
Now, I want us up there
quickly, you understand?

900
01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:43.376
Do you understand?!

901
01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:45.645
- Yes, sir!
- Two Mills bombs per man.

902
01:34:45.647 --> 01:34:48.246
NCOs collect flares
and signal flags.

903
01:34:48.248 --> 01:34:50.217
- Keep to your stations.
- Oy. Oy!

904
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.527
Nine and ten section
at the ready!

905
01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:05.398
We will advance
on the first whistle blast.

906
01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.299
- 11 and 12...
- ...not slow down.

907
01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.602
The man next to you falls,
keep moving.

908
01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:11.638
Your orders are
to break the lines.

909
01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.271
Where is the captain?

910
01:35:13.273 --> 01:35:15.307
He's over there.

911
01:35:15.309 --> 01:35:16.576
Keep in your section formation.

912
01:35:16.578 --> 01:35:18.544
Sir! Sir!

913
01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:21.814
Captain, I have a message.

914
01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.816
This attack is called off.

915
01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:26.388
You have to stop.
You have to stop!

916
01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.290
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?

917
01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:34.261
Where is Mackenzie?!

918
01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.255
Get back! Back!

919
01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.024
Return to your sections! Back!

920
01:36:05.026 --> 01:36:06.592
Hold fast!

921
01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.728
Seven Platoon, one minute!

922
01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:12.331
Sir, I have orders
to stop this attack!

923
01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:13.366
What?

924
01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:15.601
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?!

925
01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.570
He's further up the line.

926
01:36:17.572 --> 01:36:19.338
- How far?
- 300 yards.

927
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.040
He's in a cut-and-cover.

928
01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:23.743
You'll have to wait until
the first wave goes over.

929
01:36:23.745 --> 01:36:25.680
No. No, I can't.

930
01:36:33.555 --> 01:36:36.758
Seven Platoon, 30 seconds!

931
01:36:48.737 --> 01:36:50.636
You can't possibly
make it that way, man.

932
01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.574
Are you bloody insane?

933
01:36:56.578 --> 01:36:59.345
What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?

934
01:36:59.347 --> 01:37:01.416
No. No, no, no, no!

935
01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:05.711
Into position!

936
01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.446
Get ready!

937
01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.684
- Colonel Mackenzie.
- He's in there.

938
01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:13.786
- Two minutes!
- Let me through!

939
01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:15.588
Hey. Hey!

940
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:17.390
- Let me through!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

941
01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:18.558
I have to get through!

942
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.926
I have to see
Colonel Mackenzie.

943
01:38:19.928 --> 01:38:21.661
- What are you doing?
- I have to stop this attack.

944
01:38:21.663 --> 01:38:22.895
Colonel, we've seen flares.

945
01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:25.464
The men on the left flank have
made it to the German line.

946
01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:27.600
- Colonel! Colonel!
- Hold him. Hold him.

947
01:38:27.602 --> 01:38:29.836
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I have a letter.

948
01:38:29.838 --> 01:38:31.671
I need to see
Colonel Mackenzie!

949
01:38:31.673 --> 01:38:33.606
There's no bloody way
you're getting in there, mate.

950
01:38:33.608 --> 01:38:34.740
Sergeant, send the next wave.

951
01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.409
No!

952
01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:38.511
Second wave,
prepare yourselves!

953
01:38:38.513 --> 01:38:40.513
- Colonel Mackenzie!
- Concentrate everything there.

954
01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:42.615
This attack is not to go ahead!

955
01:38:42.617 --> 01:38:45.618
You have been ordered to stop.
You have to stop.

956
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.486
Who the hell are you?

957
01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:49.755
Lance Corporal Schofield,
sir, 8th.

958
01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.490
I have orders from
General Erinmore

959
01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:52.625
to call off this attack.

960
01:38:52.627 --> 01:38:53.993
You're too late,
Lance Corporal.

961
01:38:53.995 --> 01:38:56.028
Sir, these orders
are from army command.

962
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.630
You have to read them.

963
01:38:57.632 --> 01:38:59.432
Shall we hold back
the second wave, sir?

964
01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:00.733
No, Major.
Hesitate now, and we lose.

965
01:39:00.735 --> 01:39:02.501
Victory's only 500 yards away.

966
01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:04.437
Sir, please read the letter.

967
01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:07.440
I have heard it all before.

968
01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:09.508
I'm not going to wait
until dusk or for fog.

969
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:10.810
I'm not calling back my men

970
01:39:10.812 --> 01:39:12.478
only to send them
out there again tomorrow,

971
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.880
not when we've got
the bastards on the run.

972
01:39:13.882 --> 01:39:15.514
This is their last stand.

973
01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:17.950
The Germans planned this, sir.

974
01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:19.752
They've been planning it
for months.

975
01:39:19.754 --> 01:39:22.655
They want you to attack.

976
01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:24.592
Read the letter.

977
01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:46.514
- Major?
- Yes, sir?

978
01:39:48.816 --> 01:39:51.550
- Stand them down.
- Yes, sir.

979
01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:53.686
Call up the
orderlies. Tend the wounded.

980
01:39:53.688 --> 01:39:55.488
Hold the line
in case they counter.

981
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:56.923
Yes, sir.

982
01:39:56.925 --> 01:40:00.526
Stand down! Stand down!

983
01:40:02.263 --> 01:40:03.596
Stand down!

984
01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:08.935
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Stand down!

985
01:40:12.974 --> 01:40:15.576
I hoped today might be
a good day.

986
01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:20.048
Hope is a dangerous thing.

987
01:40:21.783 --> 01:40:23.683
That's it for now,
and then next week,

988
01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:26.719
command will send
a different message.

989
01:40:26.721 --> 01:40:28.656
"Attack at dawn."

990
01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:33.861
There is only one way
this war ends.

991
01:40:36.297 --> 01:40:38.466
Last man standing.

992
01:40:43.738 --> 01:40:45.707
Have someone
see to your wounds.

993
01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:50.845
Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.

994
01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:57.817
Bearers!

995
01:40:57.819 --> 01:41:00.786
Stretcher bearers!

996
01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:02.555
Bearers!

997
01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:04.557
Stretcher bearers!

998
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:06.959
Well done, lad.

999
01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:08.629
Thank you, sir.

1000
01:41:10.698 --> 01:41:12.965
Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, sir?

1001
01:41:12.967 --> 01:41:14.767
Blake?

1002
01:41:14.769 --> 01:41:16.669
There were two of us.

1003
01:41:16.671 --> 01:41:18.971
I was sent here
with his brother.

1004
01:41:18.973 --> 01:41:21.040
Ah.

1005
01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:22.842
Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake,

1006
01:41:22.844 --> 01:41:24.777
he would have gone over
with his men.

1007
01:41:24.779 --> 01:41:27.913
He was in the first wave.

1008
01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.782
How could I find him, sir?

1009
01:41:29.784 --> 01:41:31.984
You can try
the casualty clearing station

1010
01:41:31.986 --> 01:41:34.854
behind the line.

1011
01:41:34.856 --> 01:41:36.557
Otherwise...

1012
01:41:39.627 --> 01:41:41.060
Thank you, sir.

1013
01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:43.062
Major Hepburn, sir.

1014
01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.807
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Nearly there.

1015
01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:04.952
Ow!

1016
01:42:07.655 --> 01:42:08.723
Will I make it?

1017
01:42:11.025 --> 01:42:12.860
Will I make it?

1018
01:42:17.065 --> 01:42:19.732
- Go the fuck up.
- Clear the way.

1019
01:42:19.734 --> 01:42:21.167
Come on, quickly.

1020
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:23.169
Get a medic!

1021
01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:26.707
Medic! Medic!

1022
01:42:34.048 --> 01:42:35.147
Just keep moving.

1023
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:37.083
Keep moving, keep moving.

1024
01:42:37.085 --> 01:42:38.851
That's it.

1025
01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:04.944
Sergeant, I have to find
Lieutenant Blake.

1026
01:43:04.946 --> 01:43:06.881
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

1027
01:43:11.686 --> 01:43:13.018
Make way for the stretchers!

1028
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.720
Minor injuries
to the far field.

1029
01:43:14.722 --> 01:43:16.155
Stretchers to me.

1030
01:43:16.157 --> 01:43:18.757
Walking wounded
to the collection area.

1031
01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:21.160
Move aside to let
the stretcher bearers through.

1032
01:43:25.733 --> 01:43:27.668
- Move it.
- Clear the way.

1033
01:43:28.803 --> 01:43:30.970
Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?

1034
01:43:30.972 --> 01:43:33.239
No idea.

1035
01:43:33.241 --> 01:43:36.175
Move along, Corporal.

1036
01:43:36.177 --> 01:43:38.978
If you can walk,
move to the triage area.

1037
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:40.779
I can't move.

1038
01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:41.983
Help me.

1039
01:43:44.752 --> 01:43:46.018
Let me go home.

1040
01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.286
Lieutenant Blake!

1041
01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:49.223
I need an M.O. over here.

1042
01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.126
Sir, he's out.

1043
01:43:54.128 --> 01:43:56.929
Get him out of here, now.

1044
01:43:56.931 --> 01:43:59.999
Out of the bloody way.

1045
01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:02.134
Blake?!

1046
01:44:02.136 --> 01:44:03.802
Out of the way!

1047
01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:05.873
Has anyone seen
Lieutenant Blake?!

1048
01:44:07.775 --> 01:44:08.908
He's hemorrhaging.
Go quickly.

1049
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:10.910
He needs a surgeon.

1050
01:44:10.912 --> 01:44:13.946
I want to be left here.

1051
01:44:13.948 --> 01:44:16.315
Tourniquet!

1052
01:44:16.317 --> 01:44:18.217
- Don't look. It's okay.
- Amputation.

1053
01:44:18.219 --> 01:44:20.119
Straight to surgery.

1054
01:44:21.956 --> 01:44:25.159
My leg! My leg.

1055
01:44:28.296 --> 01:44:30.229
I need some help here, quickly!

1056
01:44:30.231 --> 01:44:31.830
He's gone.

1057
01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:34.099
I can't die.

1058
01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:36.101
Don't let me fucking die.

1059
01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.239
- I need something now!
- I need my mum.

1060
01:44:40.942 --> 01:44:42.143
Coming through.

1061
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:58.224
All right, come on, boys.

1062
01:44:58.226 --> 01:45:00.125
He's taken one in the leg.

1063
01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.127
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Sir.

1064
01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.563
Lieutenant Blake?

1065
01:45:03.565 --> 01:45:06.198
Yes?

1066
01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.268
Do you need medical assistance?

1067
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:11.070
No, sir.

1068
01:45:11.072 --> 01:45:12.372
I'm from the 8th.

1069
01:45:12.374 --> 01:45:15.007
What the hell
are you doing here?

1070
01:45:15.009 --> 01:45:16.875
I was sent here
to deliver a message.

1071
01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:18.077
The 8th?

1072
01:45:18.079 --> 01:45:20.846
You must know my brother.

1073
01:45:20.848 --> 01:45:22.181
I was sent here with him.

1074
01:45:22.183 --> 01:45:24.151
Tom's here? Where is he?

1075
01:45:30.425 --> 01:45:32.361
It was very quick.

1076
01:45:34.429 --> 01:45:36.130
I'm sorry.

1077
01:45:59.987 --> 01:46:02.121
What's your name?

1078
01:46:02.123 --> 01:46:04.058
Schofield, sir.

1079
01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:08.994
I'm sorry, what?

1080
01:46:08.996 --> 01:46:10.863
It's Schofield, sir.

1081
01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:13.299
William Schofield.

1082
01:46:13.301 --> 01:46:14.869
Will.

1083
01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:18.304
Well, you need some food.

1084
01:46:18.306 --> 01:46:20.241
Get yourself to the mess tent.

1085
01:46:35.022 --> 01:46:39.925
If I may, I'd like
to write to your mother.

1086
01:46:39.927 --> 01:46:41.862
Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.

1087
01:46:44.499 --> 01:46:46.435
Of course.

1088
01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:51.970
He was...

1089
01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:53.841
He was a good man.

1090
01:46:55.677 --> 01:46:57.845
Always telling funny stories.

1091
01:47:00.382 --> 01:47:02.351
He saved my life.

1092
01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:08.089
I am glad you were with him.

1093
01:47:14.128 --> 01:47:16.063
Thank you, Will.
