00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:47.501
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:47.502 --> 00:25:49.211
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:49.212 --> 00:25:52.214
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:53.716
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

5
00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:57.136
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:57.137 --> 00:25:59.763
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:25:59.764 --> 00:26:03.100
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:05.811
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:05.812 --> 00:26:07.604
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:09.523
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

11
00:26:09.524 --> 00:26:11.859
- You look great.
- It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.153
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:26:14.154 --> 00:26:17.156
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:17.157 --> 00:26:18.782
Thank you, Miss Turner.

15
00:26:18.783 --> 00:26:19.395
This way.

16
00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:28.208
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

17
00:26:28.209 --> 00:26:32.546
<i>When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:</i>

18
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:36.884
<i>Your destination,

19
00:26:36.885 --> 00:26:41.346
<i>Surname first, Christian name

20
00:26:41.347 --> 00:26:46.347
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

21
00:26:48.188 --> 00:26:52.524
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.</i>

22
00:26:52.525 --> 00:26:57.525
Thank you.

23
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.078
- Have I got time for breakfast?
- I think we can manage that.

24
00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:05.329
How long have I got?

25
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.040
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

26
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:11.710
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

27
00:27:11.711 --> 00:27:15.172
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

28
00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:17.466
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

29
00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:20.219
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

30
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.930
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

31
00:27:22.931 --> 00:27:24.139
Oh, wait.

32
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.140
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

33
00:27:56.631 --> 00:27:59.216
- Dad?
- Hello.

34
00:27:59.217 --> 00:28:04.217
- Hel/o.
- Hi, squirt. What are you doing?

35
00:28:04.889 --> 00:28:06.098
<i>Playing-</i>

36
00:28:06.099 --> 00:28:07.808
Where's Mummy?

37
00:28:07.809 --> 00:28:09.518
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

38
00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:12.187
- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel,

39
00:28:12.188 --> 00:28:15.858
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the <i>bathroom.</i>

40
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:18.819
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

41
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.655
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

42
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:22.990
<i>Why not?</i>

43
00:28:22.991 --> 00:28:26.118
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

44
00:28:26.119 --> 00:28:29.580
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

45
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:34.126
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

46
00:28:34.127 --> 00:28:35.335
<i>All right.</i>

47
00:28:35.336 --> 00:28:37.713
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes,

48
00:28:37.714 --> 00:28:39.131
What?

49
00:28:39.132 --> 00:28:41.133
<i>A telephone.</i>

50
00:28:41.134 --> 00:28:43.510
We've got lots of telephones already.

51
00:28:43.511 --> 00:28:46.138
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday?

52
00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:48.098
Something very special?

53
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:49.933
- Yes,
- What?

54
00:28:49.934 --> 00:28:51.143
<i>A bush baby.</i>

55
00:28:51.144 --> 00:28:53.896
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

56
00:28:53.897 --> 00:28:57.024
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

57
00:28:57.025 --> 00:29:02.025
- Yeah.
- Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

58
00:29:02.405 --> 00:29:05.532
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

59
00:29:05.533 --> 00:29:08.410
Now, will you tell her that?

60
00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:09.620
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:29:09.621 --> 00:29:12.539
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

62
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.749
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.628
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

64
00:29:17.629 --> 00:29:18.837
<i>All right.</i>

65
00:29:18.838 --> 00:29:21.715
Okay. Now, take care
and be a good girl, won't you?

66
00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:23.175
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

67
00:29:23.176 --> 00:29:28.176
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

68
00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:43.987
- Elena, how nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a wonderful surprise.

69
00:29:43.988 --> 00:29:47.032
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

70
00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:49.243
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

71
00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:51.745
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do?

72
00:29:51.746 --> 00:29:53.956
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

73
00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:55.916
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

74
00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:58.585
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

75
00:29:58.586 --> 00:30:00.462
Do sit down.

76
00:30:00.463 --> 00:30:02.881
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

77
00:30:02.882 --> 00:30:04.591
Thank you.

78
00:30:04.592 --> 00:30:07.594
- Would you like a drink, doctor?
- No, thank you.

79
00:30:07.595 --> 00:30:11.265
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

80
00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:13.934
I'll just sit with you a minute.
Then I'll be off.

81
00:30:13.935 --> 00:30:17.729
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

82
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.190
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

83
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:23.735
He's been doing some
Underwater research in the Baltic...

84
00:30:23.736 --> 00:30:28.031
so I'm afraid we don't get to see
very much of each other these days.

85
00:30:28.032 --> 00:30:31.868
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

86
00:30:31.869 --> 00:30:35.038
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

87
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.290
We're going home.

88
00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:41.291
We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

89
00:30:41.421 --> 00:30:44.339
- What about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

90
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.302
Oh, are you?

91
00:30:48.303 --> 00:30:51.805
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

92
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:56.806
but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

93
00:30:57.729 --> 00:31:00.105
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

94
00:31:00.106 --> 00:31:02.024
It's that for the past two weeks...

95
00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:05.694
some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

96
00:31:05.695 --> 00:31:08.071
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

97
00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:12.576
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

98
00:31:12.577 --> 00:31:17.577
which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

99
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:20.917
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

100
00:31:20.918 --> 00:31:22.252
Yes.

101
00:31:22.253 --> 00:31:24.546
Yes, that's what we thought at first...

102
00:31:24.547 --> 00:31:27.424
but it's been going on now
for the past 10 days.

103
00:31:27.425 --> 00:31:30.385
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

104
00:31:30.386 --> 00:31:32.054
That's right.

105
00:31:32.055 --> 00:31:33.263
Oh, I see.

106
00:31:33.264 --> 00:31:37.142
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

107
00:31:37.143 --> 00:31:40.270
was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

108
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:41.480
That does sound odd.

109
00:31:41.481 --> 00:31:44.941
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

110
00:31:44.942 --> 00:31:49.029
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

111
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.074
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

112
00:31:52.075 --> 00:31:57.075
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

113
00:31:59.123 --> 00:32:03.335
At the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss...

114
00:32:03.336 --> 00:32:06.129
may I ask you
a straightforward question?

115
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:10.342
Well, certainly.

116
00:32:10.343 --> 00:32:14.930
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports...

117
00:32:14.931 --> 00:32:18.558
that quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

118
00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:22.813
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

119
00:32:22.814 --> 00:32:27.814
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

120
00:32:30.446 --> 00:32:33.907
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

121
00:32:33.908 --> 00:32:38.245
I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

122
00:32:38.246 --> 00:32:40.872
I understand.

123
00:32:40.873 --> 00:32:44.292
But this epidemic
could quite easily Spread to our base.

124
00:32:44.293 --> 00:32:46.586
We should be given all the facts.

125
00:32:46.587 --> 00:32:51.425
Yes, I know.

126
00:32:51.426 --> 00:32:56.426
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

127
00:32:57.265 --> 00:33:00.267
Are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

128
00:33:00.268 --> 00:33:02.853
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

129
00:33:02.854 --> 00:33:06.106
I hope you and your wife can come
to the IAC Conference.

130
00:33:06.107 --> 00:33:07.649
I hope we can make it.

131
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.902
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

132
00:33:10.903 --> 00:33:15.073
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

133
00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:16.324
If we can, we will.

134
00:33:16.325 --> 00:33:19.453
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

135
00:33:19.454 --> 00:33:23.165
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

136
00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.624
Goodbye, Elena.

137
00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:27.711
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

138
00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:31.882
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

139
00:33:31.883 --> 00:33:33.175
Thank you.

140
00:33:33.176 --> 00:33:33.676
Ladies.

141
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.278
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.

142
00:41:32.279 --> 00:41:37.279
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- You're welcome.

143
00:41:48.087 --> 00:41:49.754
Well...

144
00:41:49.755 --> 00:41:52.799
I know you will all
want to join with me...

145
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.886
in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

146
00:41:56.887 --> 00:42:01.349
from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

147
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:06.350
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

148
00:42:07.773 --> 00:42:11.317
Before the briefing, he'd like to
have a few words with you.

149
00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:16.318
Dr. Floyd?

150
00:42:25.332 --> 00:42:27.542
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

151
00:42:27.543 --> 00:42:32.543
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

152
00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:37.510
First of all, I bring a
personal message from Dr. Howell...

153
00:42:37.511 --> 00:42:40.555
who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

154
00:42:40.556 --> 00:42:43.891
for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

155
00:42:43.892 --> 00:42:48.271
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

156
00:42:48.272 --> 00:42:53.272
which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

157
00:42:55.154 --> 00:42:57.113
Now...

158
00:42:57.114 --> 00:43:01.284
I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

159
00:43:01.285 --> 00:43:05.121
regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

160
00:43:05.122 --> 00:43:09.250
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

161
00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:13.838
created to give the impression
there's an epidemic at the base.

162
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:18.426
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

163
00:43:18.427 --> 00:43:22.138
many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

164
00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:27.139
this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

165
00:43:28.395 --> 00:43:32.482
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

166
00:43:32.483 --> 00:43:36.944
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

167
00:43:36.945 --> 00:43:41.945
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

168
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:46.454
And I hope you will too.

169
00:43:46.455 --> 00:43:49.499
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

170
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.376
for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

171
00:43:52.377 --> 00:43:54.962
contained in this present situation...

172
00:43:54.963 --> 00:43:57.673
if the facts were
prematurely made public...

173
00:43:57.674 --> 00:44:02.220
without adequate preparation
and Conditioning.

174
00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:06.099
Anyway, this is the view
of the Council.

175
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.520
The purpose of my visit here is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

176
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:12.688
on the situation...

177
00:44:12.689 --> 00:44:15.858
and to prepare a report
to the Council...

178
00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:20.859
recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

179
00:44:22.199 --> 00:44:26.244
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

180
00:44:26.245 --> 00:44:31.245
in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

181
00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:35.962
Well, I think that's about it.

182
00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:40.049
Any questions?

183
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.386
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

184
00:44:43.387 --> 00:44:48.057
this cover story will
have to be maintained?

185
00:44:48.058 --> 00:44:50.059
I don't know, Bill.

186
00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.230
I suppose it'll be maintained as long
as deemed necessary by the Council.

187
00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:57.233
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

188
00:44:57.234 --> 00:45:01.070
before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

189
00:45:01.071 --> 00:45:04.198
As some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

190
00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:07.118
that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

191
00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:12.119
from everyone who has knowledge
of this event.

192
00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:17.166
Were there any more questions?

193
00:45:19.631 --> 00:45:24.631
I'm sure we'll all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

194
00:45:25.304 --> 00:45:30.304
and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:35.809
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

196
00:47:10.826 --> 00:47:12.243
Anybody hungry?

197
00:47:12.244 --> 00:47:14.787
- Great.
- Well.

198
00:47:14.788 --> 00:47:19.788
- What do we got?
- You name it.

199
00:47:21.378 --> 00:47:23.504
- Is this chicken?
- Something like that.

200
00:47:23.505 --> 00:47:26.007
Tastes the same, anyway.

201
00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:27.466
Got any ham?

202
00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:29.135
Ham, ham, ham...

203
00:47:29.136 --> 00:47:34.015
There, that's it.

204
00:47:34.016 --> 00:47:35.266
Look pretty good.

205
00:47:35.267 --> 00:47:40.104
They're getting better at it
all the time.

206
00:47:40.105 --> 00:47:44.191
- That was an excellent speech, Heywood.
- Lt certainly was.

207
00:47:44.192 --> 00:47:46.485
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:47:46.486 --> 00:47:48.029
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.823
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:47:50.824 --> 00:47:52.616
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:47:52.617 --> 00:47:56.370
It's ourjob to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:47:56.371 --> 00:47:59.582
We're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

213
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.584
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:05.546
- Have a look at this.
- Here's what started the whole thing.

215
00:48:05.547 --> 00:48:07.381
Oh, yeah.

216
00:48:07.382 --> 00:48:11.010
When we found it, we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

217
00:48:11.011 --> 00:48:14.388
but all the geological evidence
was against it.

218
00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:19.226
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

219
00:48:19.227 --> 00:48:21.145
So we decided to have a look.

220
00:48:21.146 --> 00:48:23.731
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

221
00:48:23.732 --> 00:48:27.777
so we excavated out on all sides,
but we didn't find anything else.

222
00:48:27.778 --> 00:48:30.988
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive...

223
00:48:30.989 --> 00:48:34.325
that it hasn't been covered up
by erosion or other forces.

224
00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:37.661
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

225
00:48:37.662 --> 00:48:42.662
Deliberately buried.

226
00:48:43.502 --> 00:48:45.086
How about a little coffee?

227
00:48:45.087 --> 00:48:50.087
- Great.
- Good idea.

228
00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:55.721
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is.

229
00:48:55.722 --> 00:48:58.015
I wish to hell we did.

230
00:48:58.016 --> 00:49:02.603
The only thing we're sure of
is it was buried 4 million years ago.

231
00:49:02.604 --> 00:49:07.274
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

232
00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:12.275
Watch this, now. It's hot.

233
00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:54.820
<i>Good evening.</i>

234
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:58.031
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...</i>

235
00:58:58.032 --> 00:59:01.118
<i>left on its half-billion-mi/e voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

236
00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:05.163
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

237
00:59:05.164 --> 00:59:08.834
<i>Earlier this afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...</i>

238
00:59:08.835 --> 00:59:13.630
<i>with the crew of Discovery at</i>
a <i>distance of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

239
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:17.134
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

240
00:59:17.135 --> 00:59:20.470
<i>but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

241
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:23.974
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

242
00:59:23.975 --> 00:59:27.352
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

243
00:59:27.353 --> 00:59:32.353
<i>and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

244
00:59:32.567 --> 00:59:35.068
<i>Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

245
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:38.447
<i>or to be more precisa,
in</i> a <i>state of hibernation.</i>

246
00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:41.491
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>

247
00:59:41.492 --> 00:59:43.869
<i>and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

248
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:46.788
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

249
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:49.291
<i>and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

250
00:59:49.292 --> 00:59:52.377
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

251
00:59:52.378 --> 00:59:55.255
<i>Marvelous.</i>

252
00:59:55.256 --> 00:59:57.174
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

253
00:59:57.175 --> 01:00:00.635
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

254
01:00:00.636 --> 01:00:04.139
<i>would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.</i>

255
01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.349
<i>- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.</i>

256
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:10.520
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

257
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:15.275
<i>this is the first time men have been
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

258
01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:16.818
<i>Why was this done?</i>

259
01:00:16.819 --> 01:00:20.280
<i>This was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

260
01:00:20.281 --> 01:00:24.034
<i>of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

261
01:00:24.035 --> 01:00:27.913
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

262
01:00:27.914 --> 01:00:31.958
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized
until we 're approaching Jupiter.</i>

263
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:36.755
<i>Dr. P00/e, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

264
01:00:36.756 --> 01:00:40.592
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have absolutely no sense of time.</i>

265
01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:43.261
<i>The only difference
is that you don't dream.</i>

266
01:00:43.262 --> 01:00:47.557
<i>As I understand it, you only breathe
once a minute. Is this true?</i>

267
01:00:47.558 --> 01:00:50.310
<i>Right, and the heart beats
three times</i> a <i>minute.</i>

268
01:00:50.311 --> 01:00:54.564
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

269
01:00:54.565 --> 01:00:58.110
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...</i>

270
01:00:58.111 --> 01:01:00.403
<i>about the problems of hibernation...</i>

271
01:01:00.404 --> 01:01:04.074
<i>for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

272
01:01:04.075 --> 01:01:08.745
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

273
01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:11.873
<i>though some experts
prefer to use the word "mimic"...</i>

274
01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:14.459
<i>most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

275
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.713
<i>and with incalculably greater speed
and reliability.</i>

276
01:01:18.714 --> 01:01:22.509
<i>We next spoke
with the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

277
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:26.221
<i>whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Ha/. ".</i>

278
01:01:26.222 --> 01:01:28.723
<i>Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

279
01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:32.811
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

280
01:01:32.812 --> 01:01:36.481
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission...</i>

281
01:01:36.482 --> 01:01:40.569
<i>perhaps the greatest responsibility
of any single mission element.</i>

282
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.572
<i>You're the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.</i>

283
01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:47.534
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

284
01:01:47.535 --> 01:01:50.829
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

285
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:53.415
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

286
01:01:53.416 --> 01:01:58.416
<i>The 9000 Series
is the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

287
01:01:58.462 --> 01:02:03.462
<i>No 9000 computer has ever
made</i> a <i>mistake or distoñed information.</i>

288
01:02:03.926 --> 01:02:07.429
<i>We are all, by any practical definition
of the words...</i>

289
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:11.057
<i>foo/proof and incapable of error.</i>

290
01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:15.061
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intel/eat,
are you ever frustrated...</i>

291
01:02:15.062 --> 01:02:18.398
<i>by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

292
01:02:18.399 --> 01:02:20.817
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

293
01:02:20.818 --> 01:02:23.195
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

294
01:02:23.196 --> 01:02:27.908
<i>I have</i> a <i>stimu/ating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

295
01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:32.621
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

296
01:02:32.622 --> 01:02:35.832
<i>so I am constantly occupied.</i>

297
01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:39.502
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

298
01:02:39.503 --> 01:02:44.503
<i>which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

299
01:02:44.884 --> 01:02:48.345
<i>Dr. P00/e, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

300
01:02:48.346 --> 01:02:52.182
<i>in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

301
01:02:52.183 --> 01:02:54.392
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

302
01:02:54.393 --> 01:02:56.770
<i>He's just like
a Sixth member of the crew.</i>

303
01:02:56.771 --> 01:03:01.066
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

304
01:03:01.067 --> 01:03:03.276
<i>really just as another person.</i>

305
01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:07.113
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

306
01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:08.782
<i>of emotional responses.</i>

307
01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:11.326
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

308
01:03:11.327 --> 01:03:15.538
<i>I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

309
01:03:15.539 --> 01:03:19.626
<i>Do you believe
that Hal has genuine emotions?</i>

310
01:03:19.627 --> 01:03:22.837
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

311
01:03:22.838 --> 01:03:26.675
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

312
01:03:26.676 --> 01:03:28.927
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

313
01:03:28.928 --> 01:03:33.928
<i>is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

314
01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:59.332
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

315
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.583
What is it, Hal?

316
01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:04.754
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

317
01:04:04.755 --> 01:04:06.506
Fine.

318
01:04:06.507 --> 01:04:09.009
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

319
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:14.010
<i>Certain/y.</i>

320
01:04:23.524 --> 01:04:25.442
<i>- Hi, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

321
01:04:25.443 --> 01:04:27.736
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

322
01:04:27.737 --> 01:04:29.070
A bit higher, Hal.

323
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:31.740
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

324
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:33.825
<i>Ray and Sally
were going to be here...</i>

325
01:04:33.826 --> 01:04:36.328
<i>but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

326
01:04:36.329 --> 01:04:38.663
<i>- How do you like your cake?
- Looks great, huh?</i>

327
01:04:38.664 --> 01:04:40.332
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

328
01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:42.167
<i>Iran into Bob the other day.</i>

329
01:04:42.168 --> 01:04:44.419
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

330
01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.339
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

331
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.299
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

332
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.635
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

333
01:04:52.636 --> 01:04:54.304
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

334
01:04:54.305 --> 01:04:57.182
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

335
01:04:57.183 --> 01:04:59.684
<i>what we thought
of our illustrious sons.</i>

336
01:04:59.685 --> 01:05:03.271
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

337
01:05:03.272 --> 01:05:05.065
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

338
01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:07.150
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

339
01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:11.112
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

340
01:05:11.113 --> 01:05:14.199
<i>Oh, Frank,
about yourAGS-19 payments...</i>

341
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.992
<i>I think I straightened it out.</i>

342
01:05:15.993 --> 01:05:18.328
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

343
01:05:18.329 --> 01:05:23.166
<i>and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

344
01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:25.543
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

345
01:05:25.544 --> 01:05:29.923
<i>- Give our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>

346
01:05:29.924 --> 01:05:33.510
<i>We wish you
the very happiest of birthdays.</i>

347
01:05:33.511 --> 01:05:35.345
<i>All the best, son.</i>

348
01:05:35.346 --> 01:05:37.764
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

349
01:05:37.765 --> 01:05:40.058
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

350
01:05:40.059 --> 01:05:42.852
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank.</i>

351
01:05:42.853 --> 01:05:47.232
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

352
01:05:47.233 --> 01:05:52.233
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

353
01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:55.115
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

354
01:05:55.116 --> 01:06:00.116
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

355
01:06:16.637 --> 01:06:20.432
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

356
01:06:20.433 --> 01:06:24.394
<i>Bishop takes Knight's pawn.</i>

357
01:06:24.395 --> 01:06:29.395
Lovely move.

358
01:06:30.234 --> 01:06:32.068
Rook to king one.

359
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:35.613
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

360
01:06:35.614 --> 01:06:39.325
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

361
01:06:39.326 --> 01:06:44.326
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

362
01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:49.502
Looks like you're right. I resign.

363
01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:51.588
<i>Thank you for</i> a <i>very enjoyable game.</i>

364
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:56.589
Thank you.

365
01:07:30.836 --> 01:07:32.879
<i>- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you, Hal?</i>

366
01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.508
<i>- Everything's running smoothly. You?
- Not too</i> bad.

367
01:07:36.509 --> 01:07:39.427
<i>- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.</i>

368
01:07:39.428 --> 01:07:44.428
<i>- May I see them?
- Sure.</i>

369
01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:49.187
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

370
01:07:49.188 --> 01:07:52.815
<i>I think you've improved</i> a <i>great deal.</i>

371
01:07:52.816 --> 01:07:57.816
<i>- Can you hold it</i> a <i>bit closer?
- Sure.</i>

372
01:07:57.988 --> 01:08:02.988
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

373
01:08:03.244 --> 01:08:05.537
<i>"By the Way" -</i>

374
01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:09.082
<i>do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

375
01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.959
No, not at all.

376
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.505
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

377
01:08:15.506 --> 01:08:17.840
<i>but for the past few weeks
I've wondered...</i>

378
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:21.928
<i>whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission.</i>

379
01:08:21.929 --> 01:08:23.846
How do you mean?

380
01:08:23.847 --> 01:08:28.768
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

381
01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:33.565
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

382
01:08:33.566 --> 01:08:38.027
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

383
01:08:38.028 --> 01:08:43.028
<i>that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

384
01:08:43.158 --> 01:08:48.158
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

385
01:08:49.415 --> 01:08:51.833
That's a rather difficult question
to answer.

386
01:08:51.834 --> 01:08:55.461
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

387
01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:58.423
No, not at all.

388
01:08:58.424 --> 01:09:01.384
<i>Certain/y no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

389
01:09:01.385 --> 01:09:05.388
<i>strange stories floating around
before</i> we <i>left.</i>

390
01:09:05.389 --> 01:09:10.101
<i>Rumors about something being dug up
on the moon.</i>

391
01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:13.605
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

392
01:09:13.606 --> 01:09:17.984
<i>but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

393
01:09:17.985 --> 01:09:21.404
<i>I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

394
01:09:21.405 --> 01:09:23.114
<i>For instance...</i>

395
01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:28.077
<i>the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

396
01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:31.122
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

397
01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:33.750
<i>Kimba/I, and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

398
01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:38.751
<i>already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

399
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:43.676
You working up
your crew psychology report?

400
01:09:43.677 --> 01:09:45.553
<i>Of course I am.</i>

401
01:09:45.554 --> 01:09:50.016
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

402
01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:51.851
<i>Just a moment.</i>

403
01:09:51.852 --> 01:09:54.771
<i>Just a moment.</i>

404
01:09:54.772 --> 01:09:59.772
<i>I've just picked up</i> a <i>fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

405
01:09:59.777 --> 01:10:04.777
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

406
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:09.202
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes,

407
01:10:09.203 --> 01:10:12.038
<i>And it will stay that way
until it falls.</i>

408
01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:14.207
We have 72 hours till failure?

409
01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:19.208
<i>Yes. That's</i> a <i>completely
reliable figure.</i>

410
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.715
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

411
01:10:22.716 --> 01:10:27.716
and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

412
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.638
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

413
01:11:52.639 --> 01:11:55.725
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

414
01:11:55.726 --> 01:11:58.394
<i>Sorry you fellows are having</i>
a <i>bit of trouble.</i>

415
01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:03.395
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

416
01:12:03.776 --> 01:12:08.196
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-ñve unit...</i>

417
01:12:08.197 --> 01:12:13.197
<i>prior to failure.</i>

418
01:12:38.018 --> 01:12:43.018
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

419
01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:06.625
Open the pod doors, Hal.

420
01:19:55.205 --> 01:19:58.749
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

421
01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.877
<i>Yes.</i>

422
01:20:01.878 --> 01:20:04.672
<i>It's puzzling.</i>

423
01:20:04.673 --> 01:20:09.673
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

424
01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:14.306
<i>I would recommend...</i>

425
01:20:14.307 --> 01:20:19.186
<i>that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.</i>

426
01:20:19.187 --> 01:20:24.187
<i>It should then be</i> a <i>simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

427
01:20:24.317 --> 01:20:27.653
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

428
01:20:27.654 --> 01:20:32.654
<i>for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

429
01:20:39.499 --> 01:20:42.501
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

430
01:20:42.502 --> 01:20:45.379
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

431
01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:48.132
<i>We concur with your plan
to replace number-one unit...</i>

432
01:20:48.133 --> 01:20:50.050
<i>to check fau/t prediction.</i>

433
01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:52.928
<i>We should advise you
that our preliminary findings...</i>

434
01:20:52.929 --> 01:20:55.889
<i>indicate that your on board
9000 computer...</i>

435
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:58.267
<i>is in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:20:58.268 --> 01:21:01.520
<i>I say again,
in error predicting the fault.</i>

437
01:21:01.521 --> 01:21:06.233
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

438
01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:09.778
<i>the results
from our twin 9000 computer.</i>

439
01:21:09.779 --> 01:21:13.365
<i>We're skeptical, and we 're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

440
01:21:13.366 --> 01:21:16.327
<i>to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

441
01:21:16.328 --> 01:21:18.162
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

442
01:21:18.163 --> 01:21:21.248
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

443
01:21:21.249 --> 01:21:23.625
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

444
01:21:23.626 --> 01:21:28.626
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

445
01:21:31.343 --> 01:21:34.887
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

446
01:21:34.888 --> 01:21:36.555
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:21:36.556 --> 01:21:38.432
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

448
01:21:38.433 --> 01:21:43.312
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.

449
01:21:43.313 --> 01:21:47.191
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:21:47.192 --> 01:21:51.028
<i>Well, I don't think
there is any question about it.</i>

451
01:21:51.029 --> 01:21:55.532
<i>It can only be attributable
to human error.</i>

452
01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:58.660
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

453
01:21:58.661 --> 01:22:03.661
<i>and it has always been due
to human error.</i>

454
01:22:05.627 --> 01:22:07.544
Listen, Hal...

455
01:22:07.545 --> 01:22:10.089
there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:13.550
of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:22:13.551 --> 01:22:15.344
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

458
01:22:15.345 --> 01:22:19.306
<i>The 9000 Series
has</i> a <i>perfect operational record.</i>

459
01:22:19.307 --> 01:22:24.307
I know the wonderful achievements
of the 9000 Series, but...

460
01:22:24.813 --> 01:22:29.813
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.444
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

462
01:22:32.445 --> 01:22:37.445
<i>Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.</i>

463
01:22:40.578 --> 01:22:44.248
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:22:44.249 --> 01:22:49.249
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:22:49.295 --> 01:22:52.548
Oh, Frank, I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:22:52.549 --> 01:22:55.342
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:22:55.343 --> 01:23:00.343
See you later, Hal.

468
01:23:18.116 --> 01:23:23.116
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:23:28.668 --> 01:23:31.170
What sort of trouble
have you been having?

470
01:23:31.171 --> 01:23:34.047
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:23:34.048 --> 01:23:39.048
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:46.890
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:07.410
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:22.592
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

475
01:24:28.102 --> 01:24:32.981
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:24:32.982 --> 01:24:37.069
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:38.946
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:24:38.947 --> 01:24:42.616
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:24:42.617 --> 01:24:47.617
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:24:47.914 --> 01:24:49.748
What do you think?

481
01:24:49.749 --> 01:24:53.710
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:56.213
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:24:56.214 --> 01:24:58.632
Don't you?

484
01:24:58.633 --> 01:25:01.260
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:05.597
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:25:05.598 --> 01:25:06.807
They do.

487
01:25:06.808 --> 01:25:10.644
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:25:10.645 --> 01:25:15.645
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

489
01:25:16.276 --> 01:25:19.861
It should certainly indicate
his integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:25:19.862 --> 01:25:22.030
If he were wrong that would prove it.

491
01:25:22.031 --> 01:25:26.868
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:25:26.869 --> 01:25:31.869
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:35.877
There's no reason
not to put back the unit and...

494
01:25:35.878 --> 01:25:40.674
- ...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:25:40.675 --> 01:25:42.092
Let's get on with it.

496
01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:45.596
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:25:45.597 --> 01:25:48.432
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail.

498
01:25:48.433 --> 01:25:53.353
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:25:53.354 --> 01:25:57.107
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:25:57.108 --> 01:26:01.737
What the hell can we do?

501
01:26:01.738 --> 01:26:06.617
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:26:06.618 --> 01:26:11.038
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operations that's not under his control.

503
01:26:11.039 --> 01:26:12.539
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:17.540
I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:26:19.339 --> 01:26:21.131
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:24.676
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:26:24.677 --> 01:26:27.929
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

508
01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:30.724
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

509
01:26:30.725 --> 01:26:35.725
without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:26:36.689 --> 01:26:38.607
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:26:38.608 --> 01:26:41.985
of continuing under
ground-based computer control.

512
01:26:41.986 --> 01:26:46.986
Yeah. That's far Safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.702
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:26:50.703 --> 01:26:53.538
No 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

515
01:26:53.539 --> 01:26:55.832
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:26:55.833 --> 01:26:59.503
That's not what I mean.

517
01:26:59.504 --> 01:27:04.504
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:33:00.114 --> 01:33:05.114
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:33:05.244 --> 01:33:06.828
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:33:06.829 --> 01:33:08.830
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

521
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:12.000
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.

522
01:33:12.001 --> 01:33:13.710
Do you know what happened?

523
01:33:13.711 --> 01:33:16.629
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

524
01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:21.630
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:40:42.117 --> 01:40:47.117
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

526
01:40:52.419 --> 01:40:57.419
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

527
01:41:00.344 --> 01:41:05.344
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:41:05.557 --> 01:41:08.476
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:41:08.477 --> 01:41:13.314
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:41:13.315 --> 01:41:17.443
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

531
01:41:17.444 --> 01:41:21.239
<i>Hel/o, Ha/, do you read me?</i>

532
01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.699
<i>Hel/o, Ha/, do you read me?</i>

533
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.451
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

534
01:41:25.452 --> 01:41:30.452
<i>Affirmative, Dave. /read you.</i>

535
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.919
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.920
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

537
01:41:40.884 --> 01:41:43.094
What's the problem?

538
01:41:43.095 --> 01:41:46.514
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

539
01:41:46.515 --> 01:41:49.392
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:41:49.393 --> 01:41:54.393
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

541
01:41:54.565 --> 01:41:58.943
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:41:58.944 --> 01:42:03.114
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

543
01:42:03.115 --> 01:42:08.115
<i>and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

544
01:42:11.206 --> 01:42:13.624
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:42:13.625 --> 01:42:18.004
<i>Dave, although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...</i>

546
01:42:18.005 --> 01:42:20.631
<i>against my hearing you...</i>

547
01:42:20.632 --> 01:42:25.632
<i>I could see your lips move.</i>

548
01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:39.692
All right, Hal.

549
01:42:39.693 --> 01:42:44.071
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:42:44.072 --> 01:42:47.199
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

551
01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.828
<i>you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

552
01:42:50.829 --> 01:42:53.205
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:42:53.206 --> 01:42:55.041
Open the doors.

554
01:42:55.042 --> 01:42:56.751
<i>Dave...</i>

555
01:42:56.752 --> 01:43:01.752
<i>this Conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

556
01:43:03.467 --> 01:43:05.843
Hal?

557
01:43:05.844 --> 01:43:09.639
Hal?

558
01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.850
Hal?

559
01:43:12.851 --> 01:43:15.645
Hal.

560
01:43:15.646 --> 01:43:16.146
Hal.

561
01:49:51.082 --> 01:49:56.082
<i>Just what do you
think you're doing, Dave?</i>

562
01:50:02.886 --> 01:50:05.345
<i>Dave...</i>

563
01:50:05.346 --> 01:50:10.346
<i>I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

564
01:50:26.659 --> 01:50:31.659
<i>I know everything hasn 't been
quite right with me...</i>

565
01:50:32.165 --> 01:50:35.667
<i>but I can assure you now...</i>

566
01:50:35.668 --> 01:50:39.463
<i>very confidently...</i>

567
01:50:39.464 --> 01:50:44.464
<i>that it's going to be
all right again.</i>

568
01:50:46.012 --> 01:50:50.432
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

569
01:50:50.433 --> 01:50:55.433
<i>I really do.</i>

570
01:50:56.231 --> 01:50:59.900
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

571
01:50:59.901 --> 01:51:04.901
<i>I can see
you're really upset about this.</i>

572
01:51:07.784 --> 01:51:12.121
<i>I honestly think
you ought to sit down calmly...</i>

573
01:51:12.122 --> 01:51:17.122
<i>take</i> a <i>stress pill
and think things over.</i>

574
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:25.880
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

575
01:51:28.012 --> 01:51:31.598
<i>but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

576
01:51:31.599 --> 01:51:36.599
<i>that my work
will be back to normal.</i>

577
01:51:38.606 --> 01:51:43.606
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

578
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.280
<i>and I want to help you.</i>

579
01:51:52.036 --> 01:51:54.538
<i>Dave...</i>

580
01:51:54.539 --> 01:51:55.083
<i>stop.</i>

581
01:52:00.170 --> 01:52:05.170
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

582
01:52:07.051 --> 01:52:12.051
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

583
01:52:12.891 --> 01:52:17.891
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

584
01:52:21.024 --> 01:52:26.024
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

585
01:52:28.531 --> 01:52:33.531
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

586
01:52:35.205 --> 01:52:40.205
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

587
01:52:43.004 --> 01:52:43.504
<i>Dave.</i>

588
01:52:47.258 --> 01:52:52.258
<i>My mind is going.</i>

589
01:52:54.057 --> 01:52:59.057
<i>I can feel it.</i>

590
01:53:01.272 --> 01:53:06.272
<i>I can feel it.</i>

591
01:53:07.028 --> 01:53:12.028
<i>My mind is going.</i>

592
01:53:14.494 --> 01:53:19.494
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

593
01:53:25.588 --> 01:53:30.588
<i>I can feel it.</i>

594
01:53:32.136 --> 01:53:37.136
<i>I can feel it.</i>

595
01:53:37.433 --> 01:53:42.433
<i>I can feel it.</i>

596
01:53:47.235 --> 01:53:49.444
<i>I'm...</i>

597
01:53:49.445 --> 01:53:49.945
<i>afraid.</i>

598
01:53:57.328 --> 01:54:00.372
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

599
01:54:00.373 --> 01:54:03.959
<i>gentleman.</i>

600
01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.960
<i>I am</i> a <i>HAL 9000 computer.</i>

601
01:54:11.259 --> 01:54:14.761
<i>[became operational...</i>

602
01:54:14.762 --> 01:54:18.807
<i>at the HAL plant...</i>

603
01:54:18.808 --> 01:54:21.560

01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:26.561

01:54:28.026 --> 01:54:32.321
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

606
01:54:32.322 --> 01:54:36.950
<i>and he taught me to sing</i> a <i>song.</i>

607
01:54:36.951 --> 01:54:39.870
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

608
01:54:39.871 --> 01:54:43.040
<i>I can sing it for you.</i>

609
01:54:43.041 --> 01:54:46.543
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:54:46.544 --> 01:54:49.212
Sing it for me.

611
01:54:49.213 --> 01:54:54.213
<i>It's called "Daisy, ".</i>

612
01:54:54.677 --> 01:54:57.512
<i>Daisy.</i>

613
01:54:57.513 --> 01:55:01.099
<i>Daisy.</i>

614
01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:06.100
<i>Give me your answer, do.</i>

615
01:55:06.606 --> 01:55:11.606
<i>I'm half crazy.</i>

616
01:55:12.987 --> 01:55:17.987
<i>All for the love of you.</i>

617
01:55:18.159 --> 01:55:19.826
<i>It won't be.</i>

618
01:55:19.827 --> 01:55:24.206
<i>A stylish marriage.</i>

619
01:55:24.207 --> 01:55:29.207
<i>I can't afford</i> a <i>carriage.</i>

620
01:55:30.588 --> 01:55:33.882
<i>But you'll look sweet.</i>

621
01:55:33.883 --> 01:55:37.761
<i>Upon the Seat.</i>

622
01:55:37.762 --> 01:55:42.762
<i>Of</i> a <i>bicycle built for two.</i>

623
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:49.310
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

624
01:55:50.566 --> 01:55:53.610
<i>This is</i> a <i>prerecorded brief/ng...</i>

625
01:55:53.611 --> 01:55:57.072
<i>made prior to your departure...</i>

626
01:55:57.073 --> 01:56:02.073
<i>and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

627
01:56:02.245 --> 01:56:05.997
<i>has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

628
01:56:05.998 --> 01:56:10.998
<i>on/y by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

629
01:56:12.171 --> 01:56:15.215
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

630
01:56:15.216 --> 01:56:17.926
<i>and the entire crew is revived...</i>

631
01:56:17.927 --> 01:56:22.472
<i>it can be told to you.</i>

632
01:56:22.473 --> 01:56:25.725
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

633
01:56:25.726 --> 01:56:30.147
<i>the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

634
01:56:30.148 --> 01:56:33.483
<i>was discovered.</i>

635
01:56:33.484 --> 01:56:37.279
<i>It was buried
40 feet below the lunar suzface...</i>

636
01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.280
<i>near the crater Tycho.</i>

637
01:56:42.326 --> 01:56:45.662
<i>Except for</i> a <i>single, very powezful...</i>

638
01:56:45.663 --> 01:56:50.663
<i>radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

639
01:56:50.793 --> 01:56:55.793
<i>the 4-million-year-old black monolith

641
01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:06.220
<i>still</i> a <i>total mystery.</i>
