1
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.663
How are you doing?

2
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.966
Flight 710 to Cabo San Lucas
now boarding gate 103, first class only.

3
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.136
Flight 710, Cabo San Lucas,
now boarding gate 103.

4
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.054
First class only.

5
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.724
Buenos dias.

6
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.018
Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.

7
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:16.839
Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.

8
00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:19.425
- This is my TEC-9.
- That there is a TEC-9.

9
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.428
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.

10
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.765
It retail for 380,
I get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.

11
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.518
They advertise this TEC-9
as the most popular gun in American crime.

12
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.939
Can you believe that shit? It actually says
that in the booklet that comes with it.

13
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.609
"The most popular gun in American crime."
Like they're proud of that shit.

14
00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.403
I love my TEC-9.

15
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.156
Let me run this up.

16
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.659
- Design emphasis behind this weapon.
- Check out this gun here.

17
00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.453
This here is a Steyr Aug.

18
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.872
Steyr Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen.

19
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.336
That shit's expensive too, man.

20
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.921
Made in Austria.

21
00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.508
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.

22
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.344
Baby, l really could use me some more ice.

23
00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.349
Hold it.

24
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:13.020
Let me tell you, though, man.

25
00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:16.190
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.

26
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.775
I'm serious as a heart attack.

27
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.946
When them Hong Kong flicks came out,
every nigger in the world had to have a .45.

28
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.948
And they ain't want one, they want two...

29
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.950
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.

30
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.369
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...

31
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.205
is that a .45 got a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem.

32
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.708
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimeter...

33
00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.044
'cause it's damn near the same weapon and
it ain't got halfthe jammin' problems.

34
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.464
But you know how them niggers is out there.
You can't tell 'em shit.

35
00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:44.844
They want a .45.
The killer had a .45, they want a .45.

36
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.680
Thanks, baby.

37
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.307
Who's your partner?

38
00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.477
Cat named Mr. Walker.
Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico.

39
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.229
I get the merchandise to him...

40
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.773
he gets it out to my customers,
on all my bulk sales anyway.

41
00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.358
Before I set that nigger up...

42
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:02.111
he didn't have a pot to piss in
or a window to throw it out of.

43
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.322
Now that motherfucker rollin' in cash.

44
00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.701
Got hisself a yacht with all kind of
high-tech navigational shit on it.

45
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.829
Here we go.

46
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:16.250
AK-47, the very best there is.

47
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:21.047
When you absolutely, positively got
to kill every motherfucker in the room...

48
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.090
accept no substitutes.

49
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.094
Nothing gets between me and my AK.

50
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.680
This here is the Chinese model.

51
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:32.892
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.

52
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.894
Grab that for me, would ya, baby?

53
00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.771
You know it's for you.

54
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.483
Girl, don't make me
put my foot in your ass.

55
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:44.820
The AK-47 is the most
popular assault rifle in the world.

56
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:49.450
This is the Chinese model. You can tell by
the extra rivets running through—

57
00:06:51.787 --> 00:06:53.829
Hello. lt's for you.

58
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.843
Yo, Junebug. What's up?

59
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.433
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?

60
00:07:14.518 --> 00:07:16.018
Boring, isn't it?

61
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.271
I can sit through it once.

62
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.357
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

63
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.110
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.

64
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.904
He's just repeating shit he overheard.

65
00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:29.073
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.

66
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:32.368
- You want?
- Sure.

67
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.704
It shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket...

68
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.583
9-millimeter Luger
at 1 ,270 feet per second.

69
00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.420
At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.

70
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.964
Demi Moore.

71
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.341
Really reduce muzzle lights during firing.

72
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.430
I've never held anything
that felt so strong.

73
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:57.017
So when'd you get out ofjail?

74
00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.019
Four days ago.

75
00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:02.189
- Where at?
- Susanville.

76
00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:04.483
How long?

77
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.862
About two months shy of four years.

78
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:10.406
Four years?

79
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.325
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

80
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.369
Really?

81
00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:20.374
- All right. Later.
- Shit, l'm impressed.

82
00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:23.544
See what I'm talking about?

83
00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.838
Now, that was about a man in New York...

84
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.800
wants a 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson,
model 5946.

85
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.802
And why does he want it?

86
00:08:31.887 --> 00:08:34.722
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.

87
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.309
'Cause ofthat nigger,
I'm gonna make 1 ,250 off of this nigger.

88
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.895
So— What's your cost?

89
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.479
Low as two.

90
00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.650
- You're serious?
- I'm telling you, Louis.

91
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:50.654
Start adding these figures up,
tell me this ain't the business to be in.

92
00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.259
- Oh, I got me five M-60 machine guns too.
- Hello.

93
00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:14.845
Motherfuckers come straight
out the GulfWar.

94
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.473
I already sold 3 of them,
20 grand apiece.

95
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.183
Wow, that's good money.

96
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.268
I'm gonna make a million
dollars out of this, man.

97
00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:24.021
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.

98
00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.566
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mil.

99
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:29.568
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.

100
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:32.363
Spend the rest of my life spending.

101
00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:35.032
Pull the trigger and let her rip!

102
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.704
Hi. My name is Melinda.

103
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.380
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.

104
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:57.054
Don't clown on me, bitch.

105
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.225
Beaumont, what's up?

106
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.770
What the fuck you doin' in jail?

107
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.314
What the fuck you doin' that for?

108
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.068
Goddamn, nigger.

109
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:15.281
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?

110
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.865
Beaumont.

111
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:25.582
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.

112
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.584
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'course you're scared.

113
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.920
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out ofyou.

114
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:32.047
That's their motherfucking job.

115
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.258
The judge doesn't give a fuck about that.

116
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.261
He's ready to habitualize you.
Is that what you want?

117
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.346
You wanna look at ten years?

118
00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:44.101
Tomorrow l'll get you out, I promise, but
that means I gotta pick you up tonight.

119
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.603
Reggie, there ain't no two ways about it.

120
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.230
You're gonna spend the night in jail...

121
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.441
but I already told you
I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.

122
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.820
Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?

123
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.864
Put your mother on.

124
00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.160
Miss Gilmore.
Miss Gilmore, this is Max Cherry.

125
00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:04.204
This is Reggie's—
That's right, his bail bondsman.

126
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.708
Look, Reggie is in big trouble.

127
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.211
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before I—

128
00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:13.213
Sit down.

129
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.592
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.

130
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.970
And look, this is a second chance for him.

131
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:22.348
They don't get— That's correct.

132
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:27.311
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.

133
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.647
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.

134
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:34.485
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.

135
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:38.405
Do yourself a really big favor
and be there when I get there.

136
00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.994
How can I help you?

137
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.205
Where can l put my ash?

138
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.126
Use that cup there, ifyou like.

139
00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.548
Oh, and I need me a bond for 1 0,000.

140
00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.177
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.055
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.

142
00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.517
Who's that big, Mandingo-looking nigger
you got up there on that picture with you?

143
00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:09.186
That's Winston. He works here.

144
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.523
Damn!
He's a big 'un, ain't he? Y'all tight?

145
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.692
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?

146
00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.361
Yeah.

147
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:20.239
Bet it was your idea to take
that picture, too, wasn't it?

148
00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:25.536
All right, you want a $1 0,000 bond?

149
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.331
- What have you got to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

150
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:33.627
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

151
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.922
You have cash. What do you need me for?

152
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.924
Come on, man. You know how they do.

153
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:42.928
Black man show up with 1 0,000 cash, first
thing they wanna know is where l got it.

154
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.515
Then they gonna want to keep a big chunk
of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.

155
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.143
Fuck that noise, Jack. l go through you.

156
00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.687
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

157
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.272
I can do that.

158
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.733
Who's it for? A relative?

159
00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.194
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

160
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.573
Started out drunk driving, but they wrote
it up as possession of a concealed weapon.

161
00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:06.493
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

162
00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:09.413
They run his name, got a hit.
He been inside.

163
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.040
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...

164
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.085
against brothers from down South out here.

165
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.464
If he runs, and I have to go to Kentucky
to bring him back...

166
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.466
you pay the expenses.

167
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.801
You think you can do that?

168
00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:26.638
I've done it. What's his full name?

169
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.515
Beaumont. That's all I know.

170
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.230
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?

171
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.984
If I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.

172
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.362
Records office.

173
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.242
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?

174
00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.162
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.

175
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.290
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

176
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:56.168
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

177
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.171
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

178
00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:03.425
- Which one's for the car?
- This one right here.

179
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.012
Use that little black thing
to turn offthe alarm and unlock the door.

180
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:09.348
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

181
00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.017
Just point it at the car, push the button,
you hear a little—

182
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:16.438
That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.

183
00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.316
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

184
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.860
- I got them setjust like l like 'em.
- Okay.

185
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.624
Beaumont Livingston.

186
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.834
Livingston, huh?

187
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:42.339
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years' probation.

188
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:45.676
- You don't say.
- You know what he's on probation for?

189
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.389
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered machine guns.

190
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:54.726
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation of his probation?

191
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:58.272
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

192
00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.024
Your boy's looking at ten years...

193
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.193
plus the concealed weapon.

194
00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:08.615
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

195
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:13.412
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

196
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:15.539
O-R-D-E-L-L...

197
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.749
R-O-B-B-l-E.

198
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.419
1 436 Florence Boulevard...

199
00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:24.089
Compton, 90222.

200
00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:29.219
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

201
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.769
Who the fuck is this?

202
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.314
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

203
00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.025
Come on up, nigger. It's open.

204
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.402
My pleasure of living...

205
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.989
demands that I have a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.

206
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.867
I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.

207
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.452
OD!

208
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.081
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

209
00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.334
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

210
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:03.503
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.

211
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.088
My nigger.

212
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:08.300
Good lookin' out, man. l don't know what
to say. Thank you, thank you.

213
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.011
- Uh-huh. Who was there for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

214
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.013
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

215
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.932
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

216
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.477
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

217
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:23.940
That's my motherfucking job. And l don't
mind telling you, nigger, it's steady work.

218
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.486
Hey, look here, man,
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, OD.

219
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.488
They talkin' like they serious as hell...

220
00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.490
givin' me time for that machine gun shit.

221
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.034
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

222
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:36.036
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

223
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.790
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

224
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.459
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.

225
00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.462
They ain't got room in the joint for all
these niggers out here killing people now.

226
00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.464
How they gonna find room for you?

227
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.049
That ain't what they're telling me.

228
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:53.637
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you."
Let me tell you how we're going to retaliate.

229
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:57.641
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City...

230
00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:59.643
introduce you to my lawyer.

231
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:04.272
Let me tell you something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

232
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.274
This nigger is a junkyard dog.

233
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.735
He my own personal Johnny Cochran.

234
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.238
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.

235
00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:14.825
And like Johnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.

236
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.494
He live to fuck with the police.

237
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.497
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case.

238
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:24.126
He say you ain't got shit to worry about.
Theyjust fuckin' with you.

239
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:30.090
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on
their ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

240
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.342
Good lookin' out, man.
Good lookin' out.

241
00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.178
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no.

242
00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.180
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

243
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:41.727
Matter of fact, l was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

244
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.729
What you mean?

245
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.731
You know, man...

246
00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.734
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor...

247
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:51.153
then bam— hit the nigger up
for a favor in return...

248
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.238
but I gots to be that kind of nigger.

249
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:56.658
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger.

250
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.661
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

251
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.539
Man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

252
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:06.251
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

253
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.920
Uh-huh. And why are you home, huh?

254
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:13.341
You home because I spent $ 1 0,000
to get your ass home.

255
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:17.345
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

256
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.848
I need some help, and you can help me out.

257
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.434
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

258
00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.478
Come on.

259
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.691
- I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
- There ain't no problem.

260
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.693
It's more like a situation.

261
00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:36.072
You remember them three M-60 machine guns
l sold last year outta the five I got?

262
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.992
- Yeah.
- Well, l'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

263
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.411
There's this group of Koreans
over in Koreatown...

264
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.663
startin' this little Neighborhood Watch thing.

265
00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:47.959
They need some weapons so they can show
the neighborhood niggers they mean business.

266
00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:52.047
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

267
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.425
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

268
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.428
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

269
00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.430
They don't want no trouble.

270
00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.641
You might argue with them
about price and shit...

271
00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:05.143
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.

272
00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.145
But I got me a rule:

273
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:11.149
Never do business with people you ain't never
done business with before without backup.

274
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.860
That's why I need you. Backup.

275
00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:18.949
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

276
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:22.410
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em l'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

277
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:25.413
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

278
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.415
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.

279
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.417
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

280
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:32.003
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

281
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.590
You must be out ofyour mind ifyou think
I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk.

282
00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.843
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man.

283
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.011
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

284
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.849
I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

285
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.852
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

286
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.438
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

287
00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.191
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

288
00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.695
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

289
00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.697
I got a problem with small places.

290
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:01.867
I got a problem with spending $1 0,000 on
ungrateful niggers to get them out ofjail...

291
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.451
but I did it.

292
00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.871
How small was thatjail cell,
motherfucker?

293
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:09.207
- I know l owe you, you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.

294
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:13.420
I want to help you, but l won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.

295
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:16.298
You think I wanted to spend
$ 1 0,000 on your ass, huh?

296
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:17.340
I know you helped me out.

297
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.217
Do you think I wanted to spend
$1 0,000 on your ass?

298
00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.720
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?

299
00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:25.015
That's the only way I could help you, right?
So that's what I did.

300
00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:28.685
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk...

301
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:31.897
hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these
Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?

302
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.482
You're catching a nigger
off-guard with this shit.

303
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.901
Look here. l tell you what.

304
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.278
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans...

305
00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:41.865
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

306
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.867
Think about it now.

307
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.953
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions...

308
00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:50.624
side of red beans and rice, some greens.

309
00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:53.084
That's some good eatin'.

310
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:54.711
Man.

311
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.969
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?

312
00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:07.015
Hey, you said ten minutes. Hey, motherfucker,
you like to hit my goddamn head!

313
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.392
You ponytail-wearing motherfucker.

314
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.395
What the hell's wrong with you?

315
00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:02.672
Do a nigger a favor-

316
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.364
Excuse me, baby.

317
00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.168
Hello.

318
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.672
Hello, baby.

319
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:31.261
Well, you know, l'm just doin'
that thing l do, baby.

320
00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.851
Oh, no. Okay. Hold on.

321
00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:44.149
Louis, baby. It's Ordell.

322
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:46.526
Oh, I'm just gonna go pee.

323
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:54.701
Hello.

324
00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.744
Louis, my man. What ya doin'?

325
00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.372
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.

326
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.624
Oh, yeah? She doin' her show for you?

327
00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:03.543
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

328
00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:07.005
I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?

329
00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.799
- No, she's pretty good.
- She do Mary Wells for you yet?

330
00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:13.052
Nah, I don't know the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch ofthem.

331
00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:15.054
Uh-huh. Well, guess where l am?

332
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:17.140
I don't know.

333
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:19.976
I'm in the cozy confines
of an Oldsmobile...

334
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.145
parked right outside Simone's house.

335
00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:24.230
- Oh, you're outside?
- Yeah.

336
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:26.191
- Come on in.
- No, man.

337
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:28.401
I already caught that show.

338
00:25:28.485 --> 00:25:32.572
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit to show
you. Why don't you step outside?

339
00:25:39.622 --> 00:25:42.332
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.

340
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:44.334
Who's Beaumont?

341
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:47.212
A employee I had to let go.

342
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.761
What'd he do?

343
00:25:56.305 --> 00:26:00.850
He put hisself in a position where he was
gonna have to do ten years in prison.

344
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.936
That's what he did.

345
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.063
And ifyou know Beaumont...

346
00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:09.025
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.

347
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:13.863
Ifyou know that, then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...

348
00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:16.324
to keep from doin' them ten years...

349
00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:20.119
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...

350
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:22.538
about my black ass.

351
00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:25.625
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...

352
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:27.835
of him or me...

353
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.129
and you best believe...

354
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:32.632
it ain't gonna be me.

355
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:36.803
Now, Louis...

356
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:43.393
ifyou gonna come in
on this thing with me...

357
00:26:43.477 --> 00:26:45.395
you've got to be prepared...

358
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:48.189
to go all the way.

359
00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:51.317
Now, I got me, so far,
a half million dollars in lock boxes...

360
00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:54.487
in a bank down in Cabo San Lucas.

361
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.990
I make this delivery...

362
00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:59.742
I'm gonna have me over a million.

363
00:26:59.827 --> 00:27:04.414
Hey, you think l'm gonna let a little
cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?

364
00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:07.041
You best think again.

365
00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:10.044
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...

366
00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:12.046
and ten niggers lookjust like him.

367
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:13.965
You understand what l'm saying?

368
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:17.051
Yeah.

369
00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:22.223
- So we on the same page then?
- Yeah, l follow.

370
00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.895
My nigger.

371
00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:40.074
Miss Brown!

372
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.329
Hi. I'm Detective Mark Dargas, LAPD.

373
00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:47.665
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.

374
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.418
You know, l'm a flight
attendant for Cabo Air.

375
00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:53.504
- Can l help out here?
- Who's this?

376
00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.924
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

377
00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:00.553
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I D?
- Yeah. Sure.

378
00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.016
Would you mind ifwe just
took a look in that bag?

379
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.852
Do I mind? Do I have a choice?

380
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:10.855
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.

381
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:13.441
I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while l go get a warrant.

382
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.444
If I don't want to go to all that trouble,
I'd just take you in on suspicion now.

383
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.281
- Suspicion ofwhat?
- Could l say something?

384
00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:23.034
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.

385
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.621
l'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.

386
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:29.749
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

387
00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:33.669
Bad knees.

388
00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:35.588
You have a good flight?

389
00:28:37.007 --> 00:28:40.718
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went
down there one time with Susan, my wife.

390
00:28:40.803 --> 00:28:43.513
Fuckin' turbulence was unbelievable.

391
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:48.267
Hey, can I look in this envelope?

392
00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.698
Goddamn.

393
00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.742
I'd say there's about...

394
00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:07.453
$50,000 here.

395
00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:09.872
What would you say, Ray?

396
00:29:09.957 --> 00:29:13.709
Looks like about 50,000 from here.

397
00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:19.048
- Is this your money?
- What if l say no?

398
00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:22.677
You should know ifyou bring in anything
over 1 0,000, you have to declare it.

399
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:25.388
You forget, or what?

400
00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:29.851
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

401
00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:33.646
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

402
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.065
- I'm not sayin' another word.
-Jackie—

403
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.943
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.

404
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:42.864
Those guys down in Customs? They're a
bunch of pricks. Excuse me, but they are.

405
00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:47.577
There's something about that job makes
those people really hard to get along with.

406
00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:50.079
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

407
00:29:50.164 --> 00:29:53.458
who are really suspicious
and really disagreeable human beings...

408
00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:58.504
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

409
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.008
It's up to you.

410
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:08.431
Let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.

411
00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:12.226
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.

412
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:15.480
In 1 985, while a stewardess for Delta...

413
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.773
you were busted while
carrying drugs for a pilot?

414
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:20.276
That pilot was my husband, and l got off.

415
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.945
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.

416
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.824
He did time, you did probation.

417
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:29.952
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.

418
00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:32.455
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.

419
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.957
So you get offwith a slap on the wrist...

420
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:39.462
but all this criminal activity fucks up
your shit for good with the big airlines.

421
00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:43.382
Cut to 1 3 years later,
you're 44 years of age...

422
00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:47.803
flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin'
piece of shit Mexican airline there is...;

423
00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:50.348
where you make what— $ 1 3,000 a year?

424
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:53.309
I make 1 6,000, plus benefits.

425
00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:57.480
You been in the service industry 1 9 years,
and all you make is 1 6,000, plus benefits?

426
00:30:57.564 --> 00:31:00.733
Didn't exactly set the world on fire,
did you, Jackie?

427
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:04.445
Jackie, you have a good lawyer?

428
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.073
Can she afford
a good one, is more like it.

429
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:09.492
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...

430
00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:13.329
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

431
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:19.168
Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

432
00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:22.338
Yeah? No?

433
00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:24.840
Because he knows you.

434
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.926
Well, he knew you.

435
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.637
He doesn't know anybody now. He's dead.

436
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.848
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning...

437
00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.059
shot twice.

438
00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:38.854
Once in the chest, once in the head.

439
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:41.315
Here you go. So l guess I'm wondering.

440
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.859
Ifyou don't know Beaumont...

441
00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:48.739
why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?

442
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:58.040
Look, Miss Brown,
we don't give a fuck about you.

443
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:00.042
You know who we want.

444
00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:03.879
Ifyou cooperate, tell us what we want to
know, we'll help you get out of this.

445
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:07.967
Ifyou refuse to cooperate, continue to
cop a shit attitude like you're doing now...

446
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:11.053
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.

447
00:32:11.138 --> 00:32:13.639
With your prior, the judge
will give you two years.

448
00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:17.310
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change...

449
00:32:17.394 --> 00:32:20.313
but if I was a 44-year-old black woman...

450
00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:24.900
desperately clinging on to this one shitty,
little job I was fortunate enough to get...

451
00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:27.987
I don't think that l'd think
I had a year to throw away.

452
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:31.574
So let's start again now, shall we?

453
00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:36.078
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who
in America were you bringing it to?

454
00:32:36.163 --> 00:32:38.539
I'm not sayin' another goddamn word.

455
00:32:46.048 --> 00:32:48.924
I'd like your permission
to look through this again...

456
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:51.302
so we'll know how much
we're talking about.

457
00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:53.679
Sure. Go ahead.

458
00:32:57.142 --> 00:33:00.102
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.

459
00:33:00.187 --> 00:33:02.188
Do you mind?

460
00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:07.693
Beauty case.

461
00:33:07.778 --> 00:33:10.529
- What's in it?
- Beauty products.

462
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.492
Alarm clock.

463
00:33:15.202 --> 00:33:16.869
Glass case.

464
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.039
Birth control.

465
00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:25.753
- What's that?
- My diet shit.

466
00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:28.297
Let's see what else is in there.

467
00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:32.134
Here. Here. Here.

468
00:33:33.804 --> 00:33:37.723
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

469
00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:41.936
Let's go, ladies. First door on the left.

470
00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:10.047
Brown, case 70032.

471
00:34:12.676 --> 00:34:14.552
The charge is...

472
00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:18.806
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

473
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:23.102
- How does your client plead?
- Your Honor, she wishes to stand mute.

474
00:34:23.186 --> 00:34:25.104
Very well.

475
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.982
Detective... Varga.

476
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.192
- Dargas, Your Honor.
- Sorry.

477
00:34:30.277 --> 00:34:33.404
You were the arresting officer in this case?

478
00:34:33.488 --> 00:34:36.490
- That's correct, Your Honor.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?

479
00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:38.993
- Yes, I do, Your Honor.
- And that would be?

480
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.704
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...

481
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:44.457
and the extreme possibility of flight
due to the occupation...

482
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:47.126
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.

483
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.962
The People are fine with this?

484
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:02.224
I'm gonna set bond at 1 0,000...

485
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:05.186
and set the date ofAugust 2 1 ...

486
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.271
for the prelim.

487
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.231
Your Honor, when will that be?

488
00:35:09.316 --> 00:35:13.527
That's six weeks from now.
We'll continue this matter then.

489
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:17.448
Owens, case 72242.

490
00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:19.950
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...

491
00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:23.078
and striking an officer.

492
00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:26.415
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.

493
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:31.086
My client would like
to plead guilty, Your Honor.

494
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.839
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

495
00:35:47.145 --> 00:35:49.355
I didn't hear you wash your hands.

496
00:35:51.274 --> 00:35:53.442
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

497
00:35:53.527 --> 00:35:57.780
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

498
00:35:57.864 --> 00:36:00.032
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

499
00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:02.201
Oh, yeah? What did he do?

500
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:05.037
She is an airline stewardess.

501
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:07.873
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

502
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.960
They set her bond
this afternoon at $1 0,000.

503
00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:15.548
Now, l'm figuring you could take
that $ 1 0,000 you owe me from Beaumont...

504
00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:17.550
move it over to the stewardess.

505
00:36:17.634 --> 00:36:20.678
- The bond for possession's only a thousand.
- Yeah.

506
00:36:20.762 --> 00:36:25.057
Man, they fuckin' with her.
They callin' that shit "possession with intent."

507
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:28.310
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces...

508
00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:30.312
they calling that shit "intent."

509
00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:34.149
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession."

510
00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.193
Still sounds high.

511
00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:41.448
Well, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

512
00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:44.827
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses...

513
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:47.121
let's get Beaumont out ofthe way first.

514
00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.331
You know, l think somebody already did.

515
00:36:49.416 --> 00:36:51.458
- What?
- You ain't hear?

516
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.668
Hear what?

517
00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:55.921
Somebody with a grudge
blew Beaumont's brains out.

518
00:36:56.006 --> 00:36:58.924
Oh, shit. That shit rhymes.

519
00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:01.051
Blew Beaumont's brains out.

520
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:05.055
Police make contact with you?

521
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.684
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

522
00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:11.353
You know, they see l pay
a big money bond for my boy...

523
00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:14.356
they start thinking that
"where there's smoke there's fire" logic.

524
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:17.067
Rousted my ass out of bed
1 0:00 in the morning.

525
00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:19.361
Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda.

526
00:37:19.446 --> 00:37:22.364
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

527
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:25.993
This stewardess—
You know her last name?

528
00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:29.830
Brown. Jackie Brown.

529
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:32.374
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

530
00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:36.003
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, l like to help them out.

531
00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.130
Beaumont worked for you.

532
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.675
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

533
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.636
You can't tell nothing I say to you?

534
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.181
You're not my client
till you get busted and I bond you out.

535
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:51.560
Well, we ain't got no—
What you call that shit?

536
00:37:51.645 --> 00:37:53.562
Confidentiality.

537
00:37:53.647 --> 00:37:55.564
Why should I tell you anything?

538
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:58.025
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

539
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.402
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

540
00:38:00.487 --> 00:38:03.739
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

541
00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:07.284
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

542
00:38:07.369 --> 00:38:09.411
I'd say you were in the drug business...

543
00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:11.914
except the money's moving
in the wrong direction.

544
00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:16.877
Whatever you're into, you seem to be
getting away with it, so more power to you.

545
00:38:16.962 --> 00:38:19.588
All right. You want another bond?

546
00:38:19.673 --> 00:38:22.383
You want to move the 1 0,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

547
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.385
That means paperwork.

548
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:26.971
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court...

549
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:30.557
make out a receipt for return of bond
collateral, I type up another application...

550
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.685
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- another indemnity agreement.

551
00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:35.062
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

552
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.064
What you have to do, in case you forgot...

553
00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.024
is come up with a premium
of a thousand bucks.

554
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.317
I can do that.

555
00:38:40.402 --> 00:38:43.278
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

556
00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:45.906
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

557
00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:49.994
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

558
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:53.247
Jackie ain't no criminal.
She ain't used to this kind oftreatment.

559
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:56.166
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen...

560
00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:58.669
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

561
00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:01.547
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

562
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:03.757
Listen to me, all right?

563
00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:08.262
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused—

564
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.974
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from
Mexico with cocaine on her?

565
00:39:12.058 --> 00:39:14.476
Falsely accused of "intent."

566
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:17.938
lf she had that shit—
and mind you, I'm saying if-

567
00:39:18.023 --> 00:39:20.524
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

568
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:24.236
Is white guilt supposed
to make me forget l'm running a business?

569
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.575
Oh, it's like that, huh?

570
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:36.331
All right.

571
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:41.086
I got your little thousand bucks.

572
00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:46.383
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

573
00:39:46.468 --> 00:39:50.471
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.

574
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:53.932
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.

575
00:40:09.074 --> 00:40:11.950
Max, here she comes.

576
00:41:19.394 --> 00:41:20.894
Miss Brown?

577
00:41:21.938 --> 00:41:23.438
Yes?

578
00:41:24.524 --> 00:41:27.442
l'm Max Cherry.
I'm your bail bondsman.

579
00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:32.030
I could give you a lift home, ifyou like.

580
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.241
Okay.

581
00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:02.102
You really a bail bondsman?

582
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:05.981
Well, who do you think l am?

583
00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:09.902
- I showed you my card in there.
- Can I see your I D?

584
00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:11.570
You're serious?

585
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.498
Who paid my bond?

586
00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:26.251
- Ordell?
- In cash.

587
00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.869
You got any cigarettes in here?

588
00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:03.247
You won't find any cigarettes in there.

589
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:09.795
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.

590
00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:12.422
Have you ever been to the River Bottom?

591
00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:16.510
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.

592
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:20.055
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

593
00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:23.892
- I thought you might like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.

594
00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.938
How 'bout the Hilton by the airport?

595
00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:31.400
- ls it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.

596
00:43:31.484 --> 00:43:34.403
It doesn't sound dark.

597
00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.655
Why does it have to be dark?

598
00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:41.702
Because it looks like I just
got out ofjail, that's why.

599
00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:45.163
You're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.

600
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:57.509
No, thanks. I quit three years ago.

601
00:43:57.593 --> 00:44:00.220
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.

602
00:44:00.305 --> 00:44:03.098
Take it off and put it back on.

603
00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:05.017
That's why I don't quit.

604
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.865
If I can't fly, l'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my rent.

605
00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:25.454
You know...

606
00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:29.207
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

607
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:32.878
1 5,000 bonds since
I've been in the business.

608
00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:37.049
I figure about 80% ofthose
were drug-related, so...

609
00:44:37.133 --> 00:44:41.011
ifyou want, l could help you
figure out your options.

610
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:46.183
So far, they told me if I cooperate...

611
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:49.853
then I'll get probation, maybe.

612
00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:53.440
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

613
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.692
Does that sound right?

614
00:44:55.777 --> 00:44:59.738
I'd say that if they try you and convict you,
you won't get more than a year and a day.

615
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:01.907
That's state time, prison.

616
00:45:01.991 --> 00:45:04.284
But they won't want to do that.

617
00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:07.371
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

618
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:10.457
and a year or two of probation.

619
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:13.835
Do you happen to know who
put the dope in your bag?

620
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.420
Yeah.

621
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:19.883
But that's not what this is about.

622
00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:22.427
They were waiting for my ass.

623
00:45:22.512 --> 00:45:24.471
They knew about the money.

624
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:28.058
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

625
00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:31.061
Who gave me the money
and who l was givin' it to.

626
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.731
They found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

627
00:45:34.816 --> 00:45:37.109
They said it was him
who told them about me.

628
00:45:37.193 --> 00:45:41.321
That would be... Beaumont Livingston.

629
00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:44.032
How do you know about him?

630
00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:47.786
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.

631
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.289
Ordell pick up his bond?

632
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.586
Same as you— $ 1 0,000.

633
00:46:04.137 --> 00:46:06.388
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

634
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:09.349
- The legal advice and the ride.
- You bet.

635
00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:12.644
Good luck. We'll be in touch.

636
00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:25.509
How ya doin', Miss Jackie?

637
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:27.552
Come on in.

638
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:39.731
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.

639
00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:41.316
Got some OJ?

640
00:47:42.485 --> 00:47:44.819
Why don't you be a good hostess...

641
00:47:44.904 --> 00:47:47.822
and hook a brother up a screwdriver?

642
00:47:47.907 --> 00:47:49.407
Sure.

643
00:47:56.082 --> 00:47:57.582
Well?

644
00:47:58.668 --> 00:48:02.337
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?

645
00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:05.340
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out ofjail?

646
00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:09.427
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.

647
00:48:09.512 --> 00:48:14.182
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.

648
00:48:14.267 --> 00:48:17.185
- It wasn't mine.
- What?

649
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.939
Oh, shit.

650
00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:24.192
l bet that was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.

651
00:48:24.277 --> 00:48:28.363
Yeah. lfyou didn't put it in there,
he must have.

652
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:31.658
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.

653
00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:36.288
Bet they asked you a whole shitload
of questions about it, huh?

654
00:48:36.372 --> 00:48:40.375
And all that money, where it came from.

655
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:44.087
Probably asked you who you
was bringin' it to too.

656
00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:47.591
They asked.

657
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:50.802
And you said?

658
00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:52.887
"I want to talk to my lawyer."

659
00:48:55.224 --> 00:48:59.352
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?

660
00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:02.022
I mean, ifyou did, I ain't mad at you.

661
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.024
I just gotta know.

662
00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:08.695
You ain't asking the right questions.

663
00:49:16.162 --> 00:49:19.539
You should be asking
why they picked me up.

664
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.834
They were waiting for me.

665
00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:27.589
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.

666
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:32.636
They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?

667
00:49:35.348 --> 00:49:37.599
Beaumont Livingston?

668
00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:40.185
I knew it. I knew it.

669
00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:44.230
They even asked me if l knew Mr. Walker.

670
00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:46.232
Yeah?

671
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.403
I didn't tell them anything about him.

672
00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:52.322
My name come up?

673
00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:57.327
You ain't said nothin' about me?

674
00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:01.706
That's mighty noble ofyou.

675
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.671
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?

676
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:10.090
Yeah, they told me.

677
00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:12.092
Yeah.

678
00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:15.512
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.

679
00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:20.558
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.

680
00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:26.564
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.

681
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:29.526
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?

682
00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.781
You scared of me?

683
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:40.412
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?

684
00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:46.084
Is that what I think it is?

685
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:48.712
What do you think it is?

686
00:50:48.796 --> 00:50:50.839
I think it's a gun
pressed up against my dick.

687
00:50:50.923 --> 00:50:52.382
Well, you thought right.

688
00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:55.218
Now, take your hands
from around my throat...

689
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:57.262
nigger.

690
00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:01.391
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up.

691
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:04.519
Don't you move. Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?

692
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:08.022
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do with
you. I carry that all the time.

693
00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:10.024
You been talking to them police too much.

694
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:12.736
- The police didn't try and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.

695
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.238
- I was just playing with you.
- l ain't playing with you.

696
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:18.742
I'm gonna unload both ofthese motherfuckers
ifyou don't do what I tell you to do.

697
00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:21.077
- You understand what l'm saying?
-Jackie, stop acting crazy.

698
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:23.037
Do you understand
what the fuck I'm saying?

699
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:24.289
Yeah, woman. Damn!

700
00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:26.583
Now, sit your ass down on that sofa.

701
00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:31.254
See? Police start fuckin' with your mind,
start pittin' black against black.

702
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.339
That's how they do.
They been doing this since—

703
00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:35.592
Shut your raggedy ass up.

704
00:51:35.676 --> 00:51:38.219
Sit the fuck down!

705
00:51:38.304 --> 00:51:41.556
And put your hands behind your head.

706
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.099
This is gettin' silly now.

707
00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:46.102
Oh, silly? You want to see
some motherfuckin' silly?

708
00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:49.439
If I have to tell you to shut up
one more time, l'm gonna shut you up.

709
00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:53.610
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?

710
00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:57.572
The way I see it, you and me got one
motherfucking thing to talk about.

711
00:51:57.656 --> 00:51:59.157
One thing...

712
00:52:00.493 --> 00:52:03.495
and that's what you
are willing to do for me.

713
00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:07.290
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.

714
00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:10.585
Now, sooner or later they're gonna
get around to offering me a plea deal...

715
00:52:10.669 --> 00:52:12.587
and you know that.

716
00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:15.298
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.

717
00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:17.759
No, that's all right. It's okay.

718
00:52:17.843 --> 00:52:20.261
Now, I forgive you.

719
00:52:20.346 --> 00:52:23.348
Now, let's say, if I tell on you...

720
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:25.350
I walk.

721
00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:28.102
- If I don't, I'll go to jail.
- Uh-huh.

722
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:30.939
I want $ 1 00,000...

723
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:33.191
in a escrow account in my name...

724
00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:36.945
if I'm convicted up to a year
or put on probation.

725
00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:39.948
Now, if l have to do more than a year...

726
00:52:40.032 --> 00:52:43.409
you pay another $ 1 00,000.

727
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.291
I can do that.

728
00:52:50.376 --> 00:52:53.795
- You know I got that problem. All my money—
- In Mexico.

729
00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:57.632
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.

730
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.884
I got me an idea.

731
00:53:04.056 --> 00:53:06.558
Let me hear that. We friends again.

732
00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:09.936
Why don't you point that
motherfucking gun somewhere else?

733
00:53:15.568 --> 00:53:18.027
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow
and tell you if it's on.

734
00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:19.737
All right.

735
00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:39.966
You want your gun back?

736
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.968
Come in and I'll get it for you.

737
00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:07.535
Max, look, I am so sorry about this.

738
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.706
You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow
it, 'cause I was afraid you would say no.

739
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:14.125
I mean, you'd have to.

740
00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:17.211
Would you like some coffee?

741
00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:19.881
- Ifyou're having some.
- l am. Come on in.

742
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:22.467
Why don't you make yourself at home.

743
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:25.094
Just, you know, have a seat.

744
00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:27.889
Did you get a chance to use it?

745
00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:30.808
I felt a lot safer having it.

746
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:34.062
Oh, the milk went bad while I was in jail.

747
00:54:34.146 --> 00:54:37.482
- Black's fine.
- Cool.

748
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:40.568
Would you care to
hang on to it for a while?

749
00:54:40.653 --> 00:54:44.113
It wouldn't be legal,
but if it makes you feel better, I guess—

750
00:54:44.198 --> 00:54:46.616
Well, thanks. I got one now.

751
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.410
You went out this morning
and bought a gun?

752
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:53.247
- What? l didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

753
00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:57.877
Well, let's say I got one now, okay?

754
00:54:57.962 --> 00:55:00.880
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.

755
00:55:04.843 --> 00:55:07.887
All right! We're on.

756
00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:11.766
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?

757
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.768
Sure.

758
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:15.812
Cool.

759
00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:17.814
You know, l couldn't wait
to get home last night...

760
00:55:17.898 --> 00:55:20.400
and wash the jail outta my hair.

761
00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:24.529
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.

762
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:28.866
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?

763
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:32.453
Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford
to start all over again.

764
00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:35.456
I mean, l've invested
too much time and money...

765
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.458
in my albums.

766
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:39.919
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.

767
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:44.048
I don't get new stuffthat often.

768
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:13.786
It's pretty.

769
00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:19.959
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.

770
00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:23.212
It's nice.

771
00:56:26.759 --> 00:56:30.428
I called in sick today. As far as the
airline knows, I'm still available.

772
00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:32.180
- Are you?
- I don't know.

773
00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:34.265
I'm gonna go in and talk
with Nicolet and Dargas today.

774
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:38.186
I'm going to do what you suggested—
offer to help and see what happens.

775
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.190
What l meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

776
00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:45.443
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

777
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:49.655
Well, if it's the ATF guy that wants you,
that'll only interest him up to a point.

778
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.366
I know, but it's a lot of money.

779
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:56.370
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

780
00:56:56.455 --> 00:57:00.500
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

781
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:04.087
- He called?
- He came by.

782
00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:07.799
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

783
00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:10.134
Do you think he still trusts you?

784
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:13.721
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

785
00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:17.642
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

786
00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:22.438
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.

787
00:57:22.523 --> 00:57:26.734
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

788
00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:30.863
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.

789
00:57:30.948 --> 00:57:34.033
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.

790
00:57:34.118 --> 00:57:37.036
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks.

791
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:39.956
l mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself...

792
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.500
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

793
00:57:42.584 --> 00:57:46.337
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.

794
00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:49.048
And I made him feel like he still can.

795
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:52.009
Are you gonna offer to set him up?

796
00:57:52.094 --> 00:57:55.596
Yeah, if I get off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.

797
00:57:55.681 --> 00:57:59.517
lt's very possible that
Ordell's killed somebody.

798
00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:02.061
Do you realize that?

799
00:58:02.146 --> 00:58:06.357
Well, I ain't going back to jail
and l ain't doing that probation thing again.

800
00:58:12.698 --> 00:58:16.200
Max, how do you feel about getting old?

801
00:58:16.285 --> 00:58:19.120
You're not old. You look great.

802
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:23.249
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.

803
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:27.628
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something I think about.

804
00:58:27.713 --> 00:58:28.921
Really?

805
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:32.008
l guess I got sensitive
about my hair a few years ago.

806
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:35.386
lt started falling out,
so I did something about it.

807
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:37.430
How'd you feel about that?

808
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:40.474
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, l wouldn't have done it.

809
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:44.312
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, l do.

810
00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:47.940
I look in the mirror. Looks like me.

811
00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:50.860
Yeah, but it's different for men.

812
00:58:50.944 --> 00:58:54.822
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.

813
00:58:54.907 --> 00:58:57.408
I bet that, except for possibly an Afro...

814
00:58:57.492 --> 00:59:00.620
you look exactly the way you did at 29.

815
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:04.957
Well, my ass ain't the same.

816
00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:06.417
Bigger?

817
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:09.545
Yeah.

818
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.923
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

819
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:16.135
Something else worry you?

820
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.435
I always feel like l'm starting over.

821
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.522
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 1 5,000.

822
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:32.109
- ls that a lot?
- That's plenty.

823
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:37.365
I've flown over seven million miles...

824
00:59:37.449 --> 00:59:40.701
and I've been waiting on people
for 20 years.

825
00:59:40.786 --> 00:59:44.330
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air...

826
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:48.042
which is the worstjob
you can get in this industry.

827
00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:50.544
You know I make 1 6,000 a year...

828
00:59:50.629 --> 00:59:54.048
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn?

829
00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:57.718
And with this arrest hanging over
my head, Max, I'm scared.

830
00:59:57.803 --> 01:00:00.554
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again...

831
01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.890
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.

832
01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.643
I'll be stuck with whatever I can get.

833
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.691
And that shit is more scary than Ordell.

834
01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.910
- Let's go.
- You don't have to— Ow!

835
01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.037
- Hey!
- Hey, great, you're here.

836
01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.540
- Yeah. Hey, Jackie. How're you doing?
- Fine.

837
01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.418
- Can I have a word outside with Ray?
- Sure. Take your time.

838
01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.586
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?

839
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.171
Absolutely.

840
01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:38.009
- Dude, what up?
- She wants to make a deal.

841
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.928
- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.

842
01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:43.180
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.

843
01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.850
- Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.

844
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.519
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?

845
01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.730
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.

846
01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.191
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.

847
01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.612
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.

848
01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:01.866
Now, what can we do for you?

849
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:05.619
I need permission to leave
the country so I can keep myjob.

850
01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:09.332
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.

851
01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.543
If I don't show up for
work tomorrow, I'm fired.

852
01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.129
Well, you know what we want.

853
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.340
If I'm working, I can help you.

854
01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.383
Help us do what, Jackie?

855
01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:23.387
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.

856
01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:25.389
You never asked if I did or not.

857
01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.350
So you're telling us now
that you do know him.

858
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.895
- Of course I do. I deliver money for him.
- No shit?

859
01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:34.899
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.

860
01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.401
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.

861
01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.820
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.

862
01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:43.115
Besides, why else would
a ATF man be after him?

863
01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.664
Well, how can you help us?

864
01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:55.419
I'll do anything I can to help you get his
ass, short ofwearing a wire.

865
01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:58.672
And in return for my help, I need permission
to leave the country, and immunity.

866
01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.801
You don't want much, do you?

867
01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.136
Can you do it or not?

868
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.850
You know, I mean—

869
01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.435
It's possible.

870
01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.772
You're going to hear a guy
beg for his life, lady...

871
01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.274
'cause he betrayed Nani Vitali.

872
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.193
Read the paper.

873
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:22.279
Read it!

874
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.367
Nani Vitali, a dangerous criminal.

875
01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.452
He's already killed two people.

876
01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:31.122
You know what he's known as?
The Mad Dog Murderer.

877
01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.919
- Hey, girl.
- ¡Hola!

878
01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:43.342
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Looks like
somebody got some new clothes.

879
01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.678
Yeah, we did a little shoppin'.

880
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.681
You know, I couldn't have my boy
running around looking like no bum.

881
01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.350
- I don't know. I didn't look like a bum.
- Come on now, man.

882
01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:54.812
You know you had that
Salvation Army thing going.

883
01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:59.608
Goddamn, girl.
You getting high already? It's just 2:00.

884
01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:02.027
It's that late?

885
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.321
You smoke too much of that shit, that
shit's gonna rob you ofyour ambition.

886
01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:07.741
Not if your ambition
is to get high and watch TV.

887
01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:13.372
Oh, y'all a couple of
Cheech and Chongs, huh?

888
01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.458
Oh, don't get up. I got it.

889
01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.003
Have a seat.

890
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.798
Yo. Jackie! What's up?

891
01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:25.384
No, Jackie, l didn't get your message.

892
01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:28.721
- l was gonna tell you!
- No, no, not on the phone.

893
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.723
- Is she a good lay, huh?
- Here.

894
01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.266
You gotta make sure
ain't nobody following you.

895
01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.060
- lt's ready to go?
- Yeah. There's another bowl left.

896
01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.938
Let me go!

897
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.989
Take your thumb offthe carb.

898
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.992
You mean, the sign that's
got the rooster on it?

899
01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.039
Shit.

900
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.501
You okay?

901
01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.544
I'm just... gettin' old.

902
01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:07.301
I can't... smoke or laugh
now without coughing.

903
01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.095
Coughing's good.
It opens up the capillaries.

904
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.849
You know, when you cough, you're pulling
air— or in this case, smoke—

905
01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:16.519
into parts of the lungs that
don't normally get used.

906
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:19.230
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.

907
01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:21.482
You definitely know a lot about that.

908
01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.068
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.

909
01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.070
So, since you like getting high so much...

910
01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.405
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?

911
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:29.823
Way ahead ofyou.

912
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:31.784
See, I get high later on when I come back.

913
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.079
See, I get high at night
when I get through with all my business.

914
01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.083
That Rutger Hauer?

915
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.087
No, it's Helmut Berger.

916
01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.882
Why don't you walk me
to the door, space girl?

917
01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:48.592
Okay.

918
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.680
You know, l hope you don't mind
hanging out with Louis.

919
01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.931
No problem.

920
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.934
Try not to tear his clothes off of him,
all right? They're new.

921
01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:02.690
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.

922
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.280
Want a Metrix?

923
01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.367
Damn. Shit.

924
01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.536
What's a Metrix?

925
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.039
It's like this major meal that you drink
in a shake instead of having a big meal.

926
01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.708
It's like a diet thing?

927
01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:24.545
No. It's what bodybuilders
drink to, you know, beef up.

928
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.714
No, thanks.

929
01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.299
Okay.

930
01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:34.513
When was the last time I saw you?

931
01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:37.016
Oh, six, seven years ago.

932
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.685
It doesn't seem like that long ago.

933
01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.604
It was that long ago.

934
01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:49.903
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?

935
01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:53.449
The roller disco picture. This one.

936
01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.826
Fourteen.

937
01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.913
- You were 1 4 here?
- Yup.

938
01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.833
Shit, man. I thought you were at least 1 6.

939
01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:07.338
Well, I'm about the same height
now as l was then.

940
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:10.674
Bruno! Sanchez!

941
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.027
- That other picture, that green one?
- Yeah?

942
01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.571
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.

943
01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.990
Do you remember that? It was in Hollywood.
Were you in LA then?

944
01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:37.117
- No.
- Where were you?

945
01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.745
I was in Detroit.

946
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.705
With Ordell?

947
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:44.291
Yeah. We had done some time already.

948
01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:47.586
Were you a... disco guy?

949
01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.297
Nah.

950
01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:54.551
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.

951
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:58.681
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a fewjust to meet women...

952
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:02.643
but it was so loud and I didn't like to dance.

953
01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:06.814
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.

954
01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:10.150
So who didn't make the cut?

955
01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.779
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?

956
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.657
that's the guy that I lived with.

957
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.159
His name was Hiroshi.

958
01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.995
He must have made quite an impression.

959
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.666
Ifyou count cheese.
I never got to know him really.

960
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.669
You know, l couldn't speak anyJapanese,
and his English was terrible.

961
01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:33.173
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than myJapanese, you know.

962
01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:36.510
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.

963
01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.138
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.

964
01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.640
I never really got to know him,
but l knew enough to know...

965
01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.476
that I wasn't missing much, so—

966
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.979
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there...

967
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.565
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.

968
01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.775
- That'sJapan.
- Yeah.

969
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.361
Well— Yeah, l can—
Yeah, it looks— I could tell.

970
01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:55.946
Wanna fuck?

971
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.741
Yeah.

972
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.215
That was fun.

973
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.511
Yeah. Yeah, that really hit the spot.

974
01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.645
Now we can catch up.

975
01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.231
Yeah.

976
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:39.740
You got a beer?

977
01:08:39.824 --> 01:08:41.784
Yeah, sure. In the fridge.

978
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.835
I'm going to the bar, baby.

979
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.632
- Jackie Jack!
- Hey.

980
01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:43.345
Damn! I'm gonna have
to remember this place. This is all right.

981
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.181
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.

982
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:49.184
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, home.

983
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.520
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.

984
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.272
Yes, you are.

985
01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:58.026
Damn! I bet you come
in here on a Saturday night...

986
01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:01.989
you need nigger repellant to keep
them motherfuckers offyour ass.

987
01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:05.117
- Oh, l do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.

988
01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.496
You're a fine motherfucker. l bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.

989
01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:12.791
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.

990
01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:15.836
But it don't matter,
'cause they already know I'm meeting you.

991
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.171
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.

992
01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.299
- You told—
- 3.25.

993
01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.342
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.

994
01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:24.845
- You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.

995
01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.014
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.

996
01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.349
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...

997
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:33.145
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.

998
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.523
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know— you.

999
01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:38.483
You tell 'em anything else?

1000
01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:42.195
Yeah, you got a half a mil in Mexico
and you want me to bring it in.

1001
01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.365
- Goddamn— You told them all that?
- lt's true, ain't it?

1002
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:48.368
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

1003
01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.412
They know I'm delivering for you.

1004
01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.206
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.

1005
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.834
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.

1006
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:58.712
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

1007
01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:01.006
- Let me bring in the money."
- And they said?

1008
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.090
Yes.

1009
01:11:04.052 --> 01:11:07.763
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.

1010
01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:11.725
This is just seeming kind of risky now,
you know. Fuck this.

1011
01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:14.519
Now, let me lay it all out to you, okay?

1012
01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.522
I make two deliveries—
the first with 1 0,000.

1013
01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:21.026
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.

1014
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.528
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.

1015
01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.198
See, that's too much exposure.

1016
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.034
- I ain't goin' nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.

1017
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.411
I told them you never
pick up the money yourself.

1018
01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.748
You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

1019
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.168
- That's a good idea.
- Ifyou listen, it's a damn good idea.

1020
01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.171
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around...

1021
01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.674
they see me hand the 1 0,000 to someone.

1022
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:47.094
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend ofyours.

1023
01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:50.263
- Like a woman?
- Ifyou want.

1024
01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.016
Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking a woman.

1025
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:55.686
Wait a minute.
If they're gonna let you go...

1026
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.938
how come we don't bring all
the cash in the first time?

1027
01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.022
'Cause I don't trust 'em.

1028
01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:01.817
Now, the next trip,
when l bring in the half mils...

1029
01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:04.778
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.

1030
01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:08.365
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.

1031
01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.867
And they follow the wrong one...

1032
01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:13.036
thinking she's bringing the money to me.

1033
01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:16.623
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.

1034
01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:19.167
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.

1035
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.503
Yeah, I got the women covered.

1036
01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.047
Where are you planning
on pulling this off?

1037
01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:26.633
The Del Amo Mall, the food court.

1038
01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:29.636
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1039
01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.139
It's my plan. We're in this together.

1040
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.058
Yeah, but it's my money
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.

1041
01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:37.561
I ain't your partner. I'm your manager.

1042
01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.981
And I'm managing to get your money out of
Mexico, into America, in your hands...

1043
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.483
and l'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.

1044
01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:46.486
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 1 5%.

1045
01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.656
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.

1046
01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.825
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- No. No.

1047
01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.578
A manager gets 1 5%, agent gets 1 0.

1048
01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:56.580
I'm getting 1 5%, all right?

1049
01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.291
All l'm gonna give you is ten.

1050
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.793
And the same deal as before.

1051
01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:07.674
I can do that.

1052
01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:12.179
So he says, "Fuck that,"
and moves over into guns.

1053
01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:15.182
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.

1054
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.893
He's acting like he's this
big international arms dealer...

1055
01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:21.980
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.

1056
01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:26.860
Well, he seems to be making out.

1057
01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.696
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

1058
01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:32.365
Yeah, well... so far, he is.

1059
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.368
But you got to admit, he's not too bright.

1060
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:38.455
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

1061
01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:42.000
He moves his lips when he reads.

1062
01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:44.169
What does that tell you?

1063
01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.339
Let's say that he's streetwise, you know.

1064
01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.134
We'll give him that. He's still a fuckup.

1065
01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.608
He killed a man who
worked for him the other day.

1066
01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.193
Well—

1067
01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:13.532
So, what are you trying to tell me?

1068
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.867
That I should get out of here?

1069
01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.370
That's not what I'm saying at all.

1070
01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:22.374
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.

1071
01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:26.294
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1072
01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.091
Well, l don't know. You live with him, so—

1073
01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:34.761
No, / live here. He just drops in and out.

1074
01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:38.431
Did he tell you about
that half million he's got down in Mexico?

1075
01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:39.641
- Uh-huh.
- Of course he did.

1076
01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.309
He tells anybody who's gonna listen.

1077
01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.812
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.

1078
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.315
They're scheming on how
they can get that money over here.

1079
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.985
And your point is?

1080
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:54.906
Let him and the stewardess
get the money over here...

1081
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:58.243
and then just take it from them.

1082
01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:09.588
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.

1083
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.465
You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling?

1084
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.050
No. lt's just about Melanie.

1085
01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.845
You know what?
I'm real sorry about that, man...

1086
01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.347
but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden.

1087
01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:22.100
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.

1088
01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:25.270
So l thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.

1089
01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:32.485
So, what she say?

1090
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:35.530
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.

1091
01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:38.825
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.

1092
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.661
Melanie real good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.

1093
01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:45.498
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.

1094
01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.501
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1095
01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:51.504
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1096
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.506
Well...

1097
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:57.010
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.

1098
01:15:57.094 --> 01:16:00.013
Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.

1099
01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:02.265
Afterwards, I did.

1100
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:09.522
Oh, oh, shit.

1101
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.029
But, like, you know, what is she to you?

1102
01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:18.865
You know, she's just one of
the bitches I got set up.

1103
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:21.368
I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach...

1104
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.246
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying...

1105
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:28.750
and about four blocks away I got this young
1 9-year-old country girl named Sheronda.

1106
01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:31.544
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia...

1107
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:33.880
barefoot, country as a chicken coop.

1108
01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:36.883
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.

1109
01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:39.803
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.

1110
01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.639
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.

1111
01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:45.058
Closest she ever been, anyway.

1112
01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.978
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

1113
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:53.692
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1114
01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.528
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, l knew it.

1115
01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:00.865
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. l know that bitch.

1116
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.410
I don't understand why you keep
someone around your business...

1117
01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:04.661
and you can't even trust 'em.

1118
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.414
I ain't gotta trust her. I know her.

1119
01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:10.583
I don't know what that means, man.

1120
01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:13.169
Well, you can't trust Melanie...

1121
01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:16.673
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.

1122
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:20.260
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.

1123
01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:23.471
l told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.

1124
01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:26.141
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be...

1125
01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.102
and she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to...

1126
01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.271
but she white.

1127
01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:05.472
You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.

1128
01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.974
Hi, Jackie. It's Max.

1129
01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:11.561
I was just calling to find out
how everything went today at ATF.

1130
01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.814
Ifyou want to call me,
my home number is...

1131
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:19.027
91 5-9302.

1132
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:21.821
Or you can reach me
at my office, which is...

1133
01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:25.241
3 1 3-3688.

1134
01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.744
It's on the card I gave you
when we first met.

1135
01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.747
I don't know whether you still have it,
but it's on it.

1136
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.249
Oh, let me give you my beeper number.

1137
01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:37.921
It's 991 -1 075...

1138
01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:42.008
then dial 6872.

1139
01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:45.470
Wait for a beep, dial 59...

1140
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.806
and hit the pound.

1141
01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:50.475
Okay, so I'll talk to you later.

1142
01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.977
Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.

1143
01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.979
End of message.

1144
01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:10.036
Now, the money's gonna be in
a Del Amo shopping bag, all right?

1145
01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:13.706
I get some food, sit down here in
the food court, then your girl comes in.

1146
01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.959
Did you find somebody yet?

1147
01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.961
- Who?
- What you care?

1148
01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:20.422
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.

1149
01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.340
You send some hardheaded
rock whore up here and she—

1150
01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.716
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1151
01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:27.137
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, promise.

1152
01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:47.240
All right, so we straight, right?

1153
01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:50.034
I'm gonna roll up over here
and check out this shirt I was looking at.

1154
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.621
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.

1155
01:20:16.187 --> 01:20:17.687
Shit!

1156
01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:39.501
Max! Max!

1157
01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.879
Hey.

1158
01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:47.091
Well, hello.

1159
01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.762
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.

1160
01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:53.556
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?

1161
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.518
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?

1162
01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.189
What the fuck is up with this shit?

1163
01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:14.536
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.

1164
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.206
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can,
you know, talk about the sting we're plotting.

1165
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.959
That's what he calls it, a sting.

1166
01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.670
He's been— He's been real nice.

1167
01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:27.173
You think he's got a thing for you?

1168
01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:29.634
Maybe.

1169
01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:34.764
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.

1170
01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:37.517
Has he hinted around?

1171
01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.687
No. He just tries to act cool.

1172
01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.856
You know, l don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

1173
01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:46.651
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.

1174
01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.153
I know the type. Trust me on this.

1175
01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.990
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.

1176
01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:55.785
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction...

1177
01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:59.539
but he wouldn't walk offwith the money;
it's evidence.

1178
01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.667
- And what about you, Max?
- What?

1179
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.836
If I was in Nicolet's place?

1180
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.047
No, I mean you right now,
not ifyou were somebody else.

1181
01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:12.385
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a
shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

1182
01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:16.514
You know where it came from.
It's not like it's somebody's life savings.

1183
01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:19.392
It wouldn't even be missed.

1184
01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:22.645
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.

1185
01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:25.523
You're avoiding the question, Max.

1186
01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:29.986
Okay, sure, I guess I'd be tempted...

1187
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:33.114
especially now since I'm getting out
ofthe bail bond business.

1188
01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.533
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

1189
01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:40.246
I guess the main one would be,
l'm tired of it.

1190
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:46.669
When did you decide?

1191
01:22:46.754 --> 01:22:49.005
It's been a long time coming...

1192
01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:51.507
but I finally made up my mind.

1193
01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:54.636
I guess it was... Thursday.

1194
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.804
Miss Brown?

1195
01:22:56.889 --> 01:23:00.767
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

1196
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:03.728
The night you got me out ofjail?

1197
01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.731
Yeah. I went to pick up this guy.

1198
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.275
I hear he's staying at a house...

1199
01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.070
and I sneak in and I'm waiting for him—

1200
01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:16.532
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?

1201
01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:21.037
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun...

1202
01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:23.706
got another gun and the stun gun...

1203
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:26.793
went to this guy's house in El Monte
and waited for him to come home.

1204
01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:30.046
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.

1205
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:33.549
While he's incapacitated,
you cuff him and take him to County.

1206
01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:35.593
- You do that?
- It's myjob.

1207
01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:38.221
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.

1208
01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:42.308
But l'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.

1209
01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:45.645
The whole house smells of cat pee.

1210
01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.981
And after a couple of hours, I think...

1211
01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:51.317
"What am I doing this?

1212
01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:54.237
It's 1 9 years of this shit."

1213
01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:58.324
And l make up my mind. That's it.

1214
01:23:58.409 --> 01:24:01.994
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.

1215
01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:03.871
Which one?

1216
01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:07.667
Ifyou had the chance, unemployed now...

1217
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:11.671
to walk away with a half million dollars...

1218
01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:14.173
would you take it?

1219
01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:36.779
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1220
01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.992
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

1221
01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.162
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.

1222
01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.706
This is ATF Agent Ray Nicolet.

1223
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.041
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie.

1224
01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.586
Money exchange, trial run.

1225
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.714
Time is 3:07...

1226
01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:57.884
July 1 , 1 995.

1227
01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.470
Location is a parking structure at LAX...

1228
01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:02.847
row "F," parking structure "D."

1229
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.183
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.

1230
01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.893
I thought you were going
to let this one go through.

1231
01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:10.354
We are. Don't worry about it.
Every bit ofthis goes in my report.

1232
01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.857
The subject is carrying a flight bag.

1233
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:17.278
I am now removing from the flight bag
a manila envelope.

1234
01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:21.032
The envelope contains currency.

1235
01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:25.745
All the same denomination?

1236
01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:27.830
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1237
01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:30.374
Okay, I'm now counting it.

1238
01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.795
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.

1239
01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:38.049
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.

1240
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:41.636
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.

1241
01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.305
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.

1242
01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:48.142
Okay. The total amount of cash...

1243
01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:52.897
in the manila envelope is $ 1 0,000, right?

1244
01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:56.818
The subject is delivering
the currency in a—

1245
01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:02.490
- Del Amo Fashion Center bag.
- Del Amo Fashion Center bag.

1246
01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:06.285
- The bag is... purple—
- It's white.

1247
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.329
- White.
- It's white.

1248
01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.331
- Fine, the bag's white—
- With pink lettering.

1249
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:12.333
Image is purple.

1250
01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.377
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine—

1251
01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:17.171
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple on
it, and the lettering's pink.

1252
01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:19.882
- Right.
- A really good-looking woman on the cover.

1253
01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:21.884
Okay. There you go.

1254
01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.731
- This seat taken?
- No. Have a seat.

1255
01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.823
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.

1256
01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:31.037
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.

1257
01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:41.422
And then when I leave— Well, you know.

1258
01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.759
So, what's your name?

1259
01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:48.137
Sheronda.

1260
01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.765
Sheronda, that's a nice name.

1261
01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:56.228
Sheronda, go ahead. You can eat.

1262
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.908
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.

1263
01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:30.513
All right. I'll be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.

1264
01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:38.187
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.

1265
01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:41.023
He doesn't give a shit about the money.

1266
01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:43.401
The money won't convict him. Guns will.

1267
01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.778
You're rationalizing.

1268
01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:48.948
Well, that's what you do to go
through with the shit you start.

1269
01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:50.950
You rationalize.

1270
01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:54.537
I can do it, Max. I know I can.

1271
01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:57.665
I just can't do it without you.

1272
01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:11.053
It's cool.

1273
01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:20.938
Excuse me, baby.
Do you know what time it is?

1274
01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:24.483
No, ma'am. l ain't got no watch.

1275
01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:07.419
It could work.

1276
01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:10.214
If she handles the cops right...

1277
01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.341
it could work.

1278
01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.903
What?

1279
01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.530
Jackie Brown.

1280
01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:41.120
It ain't like I'm asking you
to go somewhere and spend the night.

1281
01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:44.331
l just want you to go out for
a little while while I work this deal.

1282
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.458
So now you're going to pout!

1283
01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.961
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes to
find her purse, look for her sandals...

1284
01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:51.130
find her sunglasses, get outta here.

1285
01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:53.215
Jackie, Louis. Louis, Jackie.

1286
01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.551
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there...

1287
01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:58.804
that's Melanie who about to leave!

1288
01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:02.266
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.

1289
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.686
- Want a drink?
- No. l want to talk to you now, outside. Now.

1290
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:08.856
Let's step into my office.

1291
01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:15.321
The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton—

1292
01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:18.157
- What's up?
- ...that day, I cut my throat.

1293
01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:20.743
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at all!

1294
01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:22.745
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell l'm talkin' about?

1295
01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:24.163
Sheronda passed the money
on to somebody else.

1296
01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:25.080
How do you know she did that?

1297
01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.416
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.

1298
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.501
I knew you would try to
pull some shit like that!

1299
01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:32.087
- Hold up! I ain't pulling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?

1300
01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:34.506
It's my goddamn money! I can do
what the fuck I wanna do with it.

1301
01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:36.842
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!

1302
01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:39.136
- Ifwe don't do it my way, then fuck it!
-Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1303
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.305
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!

1304
01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:44.558
Listen! Listen!
The woman you saw was my friend Simone.

1305
01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:46.560
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.

1306
01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:49.897
I think she oughta see
how the shit go down. She's a nice woman.

1307
01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:53.776
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's on
her way over here right now. Hold on.

1308
01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:56.445
Louis, call Simone.
Tell her to get her ass over here.

1309
01:32:56.529 --> 01:32:58.822
We waiting on her.

1310
01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:02.451
- Damn! That what you're pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?

1311
01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:05.371
I'm sorry.

1312
01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:09.708
I'm about ready for a refill. Are you sure
I can't tempt you a little bit more?

1313
01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:12.586
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

1314
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:15.297
You better give me something strong.

1315
01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:20.552
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.

1316
01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:22.763
I don't like that part.

1317
01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:25.224
It washes off!

1318
01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:28.727
I tell 'em we do the same thing as before,
and they'll follow Sheronda.

1319
01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:34.566
Yo, Louis. Louis? She ain't there?

1320
01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:37.486
Yo! No answer?

1321
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:40.155
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?

1322
01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:50.624
Okay, now, this time you're going to
get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?

1323
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:53.794
Right. The same one Simone gives me, okay?

1324
01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:57.840
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what l look like?

1325
01:33:57.924 --> 01:33:59.717
She's seen you with Sheronda, remember?

1326
01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:02.678
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?

1327
01:34:02.762 --> 01:34:05.931
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right. The place y'all try shit on.

1328
01:34:06.016 --> 01:34:08.225
It's a fitting room.
Big sign over the door. You can't miss it.

1329
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:12.980
Why over there?

1330
01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:15.816
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.

1331
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.610
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...

1332
01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.738
or even in the dining area.

1333
01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.365
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.

1334
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:26.035
Okay. Now, you're going to take...

1335
01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:28.871
the Billingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.

1336
01:34:28.955 --> 01:34:31.123
- Right.
- And Simone gon' to wait.

1337
01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:33.792
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you...

1338
01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:36.378
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.

1339
01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:38.589
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.

1340
01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.716
Hey! See?

1341
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.968
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?

1342
01:34:43.053 --> 01:34:44.345
Now that you got 'em watching my ass...

1343
01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:45.971
I'm gonna be in a titty bar
waiting on Louis...

1344
01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:48.515
to call me and tell me everything's cool.

1345
01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:53.854
I got to go! Hey!

1346
01:34:56.399 --> 01:35:00.402
- Damn! Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the ATF guy.

1347
01:35:00.487 --> 01:35:03.906
That shit work my nerves, you and that
motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.

1348
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:07.409
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with that
motherfucker, this wouldn't work.

1349
01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:12.414
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.

1350
01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:18.754
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.

1351
01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:21.256
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.

1352
01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.467
I don't know if he lives there,
but l can find out.

1353
01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:27.096
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really.

1354
01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:31.183
His full name's Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.

1355
01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:34.395
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

1356
01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:38.232
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.

1357
01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:41.110
They did two years together about,
I don't know...

1358
01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:44.405
20 years ago or so over at Huntsville.

1359
01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:47.157
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.

1360
01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:50.035
Ordell's got him staying down in Compton...

1361
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.455
living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named...

1362
01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:56.792
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.

1363
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:00.379
- You know her?
- No.

1364
01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:03.966
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.

1365
01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:08.053
Okay, who's the other one?

1366
01:36:08.138 --> 01:36:11.056
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.

1367
01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:13.767
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke l got busted with.

1368
01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:15.352
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything.

1369
01:36:15.437 --> 01:36:19.064
She's not a part of it, and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.

1370
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:21.316
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.

1371
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:24.027
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1372
01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:26.864
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1373
01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:29.408
I told him Ordell's changing
the amount he's bringing in.

1374
01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:30.409
Think they bought it?

1375
01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:33.370
Yeah. l got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous...

1376
01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:36.123
and they love thinking
that he's scared of 'em.

1377
01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:40.711
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.

1378
01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:43.714
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.

1379
01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:46.049
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1380
01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.260
What's that?

1381
01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:50.637
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money...

1382
01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:53.015
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.

1383
01:36:53.099 --> 01:36:55.934
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil where it is...

1384
01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:59.104
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.

1385
01:36:59.189 --> 01:37:01.940
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

1386
01:37:02.025 --> 01:37:04.443
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.

1387
01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:07.529
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.
He'll see 50,000.

1388
01:37:07.614 --> 01:37:10.324
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.

1389
01:37:10.408 --> 01:37:12.826
- What if he checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.

1390
01:37:12.911 --> 01:37:16.747
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.

1391
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.585
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.

1392
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.254
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr. Walker put it in there...

1393
01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:27.090
and I didn't know anything about it,
like the coke.

1394
01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:29.593
- Then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...

1395
01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.762
and at least I tried.

1396
01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:35.724
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.

1397
01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:39.186
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out ofthat fitting room.

1398
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:42.481
- Wearing a dress.
- A suit. There's this one I had my eye on.

1399
01:37:42.565 --> 01:37:44.608
You know, it's like—

1400
01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.610
Excuse me.

1401
01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:51.114
Hello?

1402
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:53.450
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.

1403
01:37:53.535 --> 01:37:55.202
No, no, it ain't no thing.

1404
01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:58.121
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.

1405
01:37:58.206 --> 01:38:00.457
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mall?

1406
01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:03.043
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.

1407
01:38:03.127 --> 01:38:05.879
Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad.
She gone.

1408
01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:10.008
She gone, her shit's gone and my
1 0,000 motherfucking dollars is gone.

1409
01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:12.177
Hey, hey, hey! Don't start buggin' on me.

1410
01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:14.346
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.

1411
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:16.557
Everything's just like we discussed.

1412
01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:19.017
Now, except for this time
when we make the split...

1413
01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:21.103
instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie.

1414
01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:24.022
I think someone's knocking on the door.

1415
01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:28.151
Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense
as that bitch has, she'd be in the same place.

1416
01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:31.071
All right. Yeah, later.

1417
01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:34.199
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.

1418
01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:37.411
I hope he's a good sailor.

1419
01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:42.291
Chickenshit.

1420
01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:43.518
Okay, the envelope contains $50,000.

1421
01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:46.688
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...

1422
01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:51.360
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.

1423
01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:55.656
Ever been tempted?

1424
01:39:59.369 --> 01:40:01.912
What? Put one ofthese in my pocket?

1425
01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:09.378
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?

1426
01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:12.172
Of course, nobody knows how much there is.

1427
01:40:12.256 --> 01:40:16.718
I guess we could take as much
as we want. lsn't that right?

1428
01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:20.263
Yes. All those things are true.

1429
01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:24.643
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.

1430
01:40:24.727 --> 01:40:27.729
- That would be one point ofview.
- Yeah.

1431
01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.942
Except it's not a point ofview
shared by the ATF.

1432
01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:36.321
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.

1433
01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:40.784
You're officially out oftrouble now.

1434
01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.953
Don't go doing something stupid.

1435
01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:47.124
How can I do anything stupid
when I'm being watched every second?

1436
01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.376
You know, I'm glad you pointed that out...

1437
01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.753
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.

1438
01:40:51.838 --> 01:40:55.340
Now, look. Here's the deal.

1439
01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:58.093
I want you to take all this cash.

1440
01:40:58.177 --> 01:41:01.179
I want you to put it in this
Billingsley shopping bag.

1441
01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:03.849
And that is exactly
what l expect to see...

1442
01:41:03.933 --> 01:41:07.644
when I look inside Sheronda's
Billingsley shopping bag.

1443
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:09.646
¿Comprende?

1444
01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:12.107
- Si, comprende.
- Cool.

1445
01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:15.527
Hey, there's only three reasons
you couldn't make your court appearance.

1446
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:19.990
One, you in a hospital;
two, you in jail; three, you ass is dead.

1447
01:41:20.074 --> 01:41:22.993
- That means you're not my friend, man.
- Winston!

1448
01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:25.996
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.

1449
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.083
- Where you going?
- Del Amo Mall. Catch a movie, somethin' to eat.

1450
01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:32.210
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon and looks good.

1451
01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:34.254
Cool. Have fun.

1452
01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:38.008
- Let's go!
- In a minute!

1453
01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:39.968
You said that before. Let's go!

1454
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:50.729
Hello?

1455
01:41:50.813 --> 01:41:52.939
Louis? What the fuck
you still doing there, man?

1456
01:41:53.024 --> 01:41:56.151
Well, l'm waiting on her.
I'm ready to go, yeah.

1457
01:41:56.235 --> 01:41:58.945
You're the one in motherfucking charge!

1458
01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.114
She keeps saying, "In a minute," right?

1459
01:42:01.199 --> 01:42:03.617
Go in there, grab that bitch by the
hair, drag her fuckin' ass outta there!

1460
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:06.036
That's my goddamn money we—

1461
01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:13.293
Hey, we gotta go! We're late!

1462
01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:18.799
- Come on, Mel! We gotta go! Let's go!
- Kiss my ass, fuck wad!

1463
01:43:03.469 --> 01:43:05.387
You wanna turn it down?

1464
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.430
I'm listening to it.

1465
01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:13.603
Louis, man, I've been meaning
to tell you you're a little bit uptight.

1466
01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:56.206
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1467
01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:59.417
I think l like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.

1468
01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:06.758
Wow! You look really cool.

1469
01:45:06.842 --> 01:45:10.387
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.

1470
01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:13.890
You wear that suit to a business meeting,
and you'll be the badass in the room.

1471
01:45:13.975 --> 01:45:16.226
Yeah? I think I like it. I'll take it.

1472
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.728
- I'm in a hurry. Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1473
01:45:18.813 --> 01:45:20.313
Cash.

1474
01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:44.421
- Melanie?
- Jackie?

1475
01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:46.923
Hey, girl, what's up?

1476
01:45:47.008 --> 01:45:50.260
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?

1477
01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:54.305
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?

1478
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.350
You betcha.

1479
01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:13.908
I put a cherry on top.

1480
01:46:15.161 --> 01:46:18.663
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?

1481
01:46:18.748 --> 01:46:20.248
Thanks.

1482
01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:25.730
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1483
01:47:25.815 --> 01:47:28.399
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?

1484
01:47:28.484 --> 01:47:31.945
Okay, there's a blouse...

1485
01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:34.405
pants.

1486
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:38.368
Comes to $267.

1487
01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:40.578
Okay.

1488
01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.998
Wait! Your change.

1489
01:47:45.417 --> 01:47:49.838
By the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1490
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:24.349
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!

1491
01:49:24.433 --> 01:49:27.352
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.

1492
01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:29.520
She took all the money and ran out!

1493
01:49:36.779 --> 01:49:38.363
Fuck.

1494
01:49:38.447 --> 01:49:41.199
Come on. Goddamn, we're late. Come on.

1495
01:49:41.283 --> 01:49:44.702
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

1496
01:49:44.787 --> 01:49:47.872
We should've been there already, and we
would've if not for your fuckin' around.

1497
01:49:47.957 --> 01:49:50.166
Jesus Christ, Louis, maintain.

1498
01:49:53.045 --> 01:49:55.296
- Jesus. Ow!
- I'm telling you, cut the shit.

1499
01:49:55.381 --> 01:49:56.798
Ow.

1500
01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.264
Idiot.

1501
01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:06.224
-Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.

1502
01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:08.268
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'—

1503
01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:11.479
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice—

1504
01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:14.732
I think l like it.
I'll take it. l'm in a hurry.

1505
01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:16.734
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1506
01:50:16.819 --> 01:50:18.778
Cash.

1507
01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:28.413
lt's a nice outfit on her. l'm gonna go
over and look at this Michi Moon display.

1508
01:50:28.497 --> 01:50:32.083
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.

1509
01:50:32.167 --> 01:50:34.752
Are you sweating?

1510
01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:38.548
Job a little too much for you?

1511
01:50:47.808 --> 01:50:49.934
I'm gonna be over there.

1512
01:50:50.019 --> 01:50:53.271
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little bit too conspicuous.

1513
01:50:53.355 --> 01:50:57.775
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.

1514
01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.528
Hey, would you let go!

1515
01:51:06.702 --> 01:51:08.202
Designer Clothes.

1516
01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:15.209
Fuck it.

1517
01:51:43.489 --> 01:51:45.406
Look, where you goin'?

1518
01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:47.408
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.

1519
01:51:47.493 --> 01:51:50.495
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.

1520
01:51:50.579 --> 01:51:53.373
- Fuck you—
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?

1521
01:51:53.457 --> 01:51:56.334
Give me that bag
before I knock you the fuck up.

1522
01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:59.253
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay. Jesus, what's wrong with you?

1523
01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:02.090
- I'm carryin' the bag.
- All right. Take a chill pill, for chrissake.

1524
01:52:02.174 --> 01:52:04.342
Fuck you and your chill pill.

1525
01:52:04.426 --> 01:52:08.554
'Member where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.

1526
01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:11.849
Where the— Which way? Which way?

1527
01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:19.190
Jesus, but ifyou two aren't
the biggest pair of fuckups...

1528
01:52:19.274 --> 01:52:21.776
I've ever met in my entire life.

1529
01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.695
How did you ever rob a bank?

1530
01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:28.282
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?

1531
01:52:29.368 --> 01:52:31.285
No wonder you went to jail.

1532
01:52:34.123 --> 01:52:36.707
Is it this aisle, Louis?

1533
01:52:36.792 --> 01:52:38.751
Is it?

1534
01:52:43.507 --> 01:52:45.591
Louis?

1535
01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:49.762
Lou-isss?

1536
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:55.560
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?

1537
01:52:56.770 --> 01:52:59.063
- It's this one.
- You sure?

1538
01:52:59.148 --> 01:53:01.941
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive? You don't seem sure to me.

1539
01:53:02.025 --> 01:53:03.526
Hey, don't say—

1540
01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:08.072
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.

1541
01:53:08.157 --> 01:53:12.076
I mean it.
Don't say one fuckin' word, okay?

1542
01:53:12.161 --> 01:53:13.661
Okay, Louis.

1543
01:53:23.046 --> 01:53:25.339
See, just where I said it was.

1544
01:53:28.927 --> 01:53:30.845
God.

1545
01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.411
Can I show you something?

1546
01:54:37.496 --> 01:54:40.957
Not right now. I'm just killin' time,
waitin' for my wife.

1547
01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:45.336
Oh, sure thing.
Well, if anything grabs you, don't be shy.

1548
01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:47.463
I won't. Thanks.

1549
01:54:48.924 --> 01:54:51.342
- Wow, you look really cool.
- Oh, yeah.

1550
01:54:51.426 --> 01:54:55.388
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great. I mean, you wear that—

1551
01:54:55.472 --> 01:54:58.391
- Straighten up, bitch.
- You fuckin' mongoloid.

1552
01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:02.436
- Now, look at this.
- l think I like it.

1553
01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:04.397
I'll take it. l'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

1554
01:55:04.481 --> 01:55:06.983
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

1555
01:55:10.612 --> 01:55:12.321
Hey, would you let go!

1556
01:55:24.626 --> 01:55:26.127
Designer Clothes.

1557
01:56:06.627 --> 01:56:09.503
I decided to wear the suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1558
01:56:09.588 --> 01:56:12.757
- Oh, that's no problem. I understand.
- How much is it?

1559
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:17.011
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.

1560
01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:20.264
Comes to $267.

1561
01:56:20.349 --> 01:56:23.434
- Here you go.
- Wait! Your change!

1562
01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:28.648
By the way, someone left a bag of beach
towels in the last dressing room.

1563
01:56:53.924 --> 01:56:55.466
Excuse me.

1564
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:59.387
My wife thinks she left a bag
of beach towels in the fitting room.

1565
01:56:59.471 --> 01:57:02.515
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get 'em.
There's nobody in there.

1566
01:57:02.599 --> 01:57:05.059
- Thanks.
- Last stall.

1567
01:58:18.133 --> 01:58:19.633
Got it.

1568
01:59:09.684 --> 01:59:11.852
I wasn't even gonna buy anything.

1569
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:56.814
All right. Just keep drivin' to Ninth,
where all them car dealerships is.

1570
01:59:56.898 --> 01:59:58.816
We gonna leave this heap
in the parking lot and pick up...

1571
01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.777
a car the cops don't know nothin' about.

1572
02:00:02.863 --> 02:00:04.363
Where's Melanie?

1573
02:00:04.447 --> 02:00:06.699
Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You
see, she was buggin' me the whole time.

1574
02:00:06.783 --> 02:00:09.410
She got pissy with me 'cause
I wouldn't let her carry the bag.

1575
02:00:09.494 --> 02:00:12.246
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like—

1576
02:00:12.330 --> 02:00:14.999
'cause l couldn't remember where the car
was parked right away when we came out.

1577
02:00:15.083 --> 02:00:17.918
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?

1578
02:00:18.003 --> 02:00:20.671
Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was totally
fuckin' with my nerves, man.

1579
02:00:20.755 --> 02:00:24.049
- So, what? You left her there?
- I shot her.

1580
02:00:28.013 --> 02:00:29.513
You shot Melanie?

1581
02:00:29.598 --> 02:00:32.516
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?

1582
02:00:32.601 --> 02:00:34.602
Well, how can you talk to her?
You know how she is.

1583
02:00:34.686 --> 02:00:38.939
- You couldn'tjust hit her?
- Maybe, but at that time, I don't know—

1584
02:00:39.024 --> 02:00:41.317
You shot her? Twice?

1585
02:00:43.278 --> 02:00:47.531
- Is she dead?
- Pretty much.

1586
02:00:47.616 --> 02:00:49.533
What do you mean "pretty much," Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.

1587
02:00:49.618 --> 02:00:51.660
- Yes or no. ls she dead?
- I think so.

1588
02:00:51.745 --> 02:00:54.246
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she—
- She's dead. She's dead.

1589
02:00:54.331 --> 02:00:57.124
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.

1590
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.921
lfyou had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.

1591
02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:04.757
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.

1592
02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:06.800
Anybody but that woman.

1593
02:01:20.523 --> 02:01:22.107
Louis?

1594
02:01:22.192 --> 02:01:23.859
What?

1595
02:01:23.944 --> 02:01:25.861
Where's the rest of it?

1596
02:01:25.946 --> 02:01:30.240
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less.

1597
02:01:30.325 --> 02:01:32.910
Well, you said 550.

1598
02:01:32.994 --> 02:01:36.455
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.

1599
02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:38.832
Look, look, man.
That's the bag she came out with.

1600
02:01:38.917 --> 02:01:41.669
- She never put her hand in it. Neither did I.
- Came out ofwhere?

1601
02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:44.380
The fitting room. lt went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

1602
02:01:44.464 --> 02:01:47.758
- How long was she in there?
- Not even a minute. She came right out.

1603
02:01:47.842 --> 02:01:50.594
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to God, man.

1604
02:01:50.679 --> 02:01:54.306
I swear on my life. She came out with that
fuckin' bag, and I took it from her.

1605
02:01:54.391 --> 02:01:56.392
- And then what?
- That was it. We went to the parking lot.

1606
02:01:56.476 --> 02:01:59.979
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.

1607
02:02:00.063 --> 02:02:02.439
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room
somewhere with a half million dollars...

1608
02:02:02.524 --> 02:02:04.692
I worked my ass offto get
waitin' for you?

1609
02:02:04.776 --> 02:02:07.361
- Oh, fuck you for asking me that.
- I know the bitch tried to set me up.

1610
02:02:07.445 --> 02:02:09.363
Fuck you, brother.
How could you fuckin' ask me that?

1611
02:02:09.447 --> 02:02:10.990
She didn't ask you?

1612
02:02:13.868 --> 02:02:15.369
Shit!

1613
02:02:18.331 --> 02:02:19.999
Pull the car over a minute.

1614
02:02:22.419 --> 02:02:24.378
Why'd you ask me that?

1615
02:02:32.178 --> 02:02:35.097
All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?

1616
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:36.682
It's in there.

1617
02:02:39.853 --> 02:02:42.563
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.

1618
02:03:08.798 --> 02:03:10.883
It's Jackie Brown.

1619
02:03:12.969 --> 02:03:15.804
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it all?

1620
02:03:15.889 --> 02:03:18.307
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.

1621
02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:20.517
Well, maybe the Feds got it.

1622
02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:23.562
See, if there wasn't nothin' in that bag
but them towels...

1623
02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:25.856
then maybe she didn't get
a chance to take the money...

1624
02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:27.858
out of her suitcase and the ATF got it.

1625
02:03:27.942 --> 02:03:29.943
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.

1626
02:03:30.028 --> 02:03:32.029
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.

1627
02:03:32.113 --> 02:03:35.949
That's right. And then she puts 40 grand
or so in there to rub that shit in my face.

1628
02:03:36.034 --> 02:03:39.328
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.

1629
02:03:39.412 --> 02:03:43.791
You know, I don't know. l don't know.

1630
02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:47.169
Unless, you know,
either she's got it or the Feds got it.

1631
02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:50.422
Or— Now, check this out.

1632
02:03:50.507 --> 02:03:53.425
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...

1633
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:56.470
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.

1634
02:03:56.554 --> 02:03:58.472
Uh-huh.

1635
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:02.976
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1636
02:04:03.061 --> 02:04:05.229
Do you know who I saw
in the dress department?

1637
02:04:05.313 --> 02:04:06.480
No, tell me.

1638
02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:09.817
I didn't think anything of it. I— No, no,
I did wonder what he was doin' there.

1639
02:04:09.901 --> 02:04:12.736
I wondered what he was doin' there,
but I thought it had nothin' to do with us.

1640
02:04:12.821 --> 02:04:15.447
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. lt's a big place—

1641
02:04:15.532 --> 02:04:17.783
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

1642
02:04:17.867 --> 02:04:19.451
Yeah, Max Cherry.

1643
02:04:19.536 --> 02:04:21.036
Max—

1644
02:04:25.542 --> 02:04:28.377
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we—

1645
02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:31.338
Man, look at me when I'm talkin' to you!

1646
02:04:31.422 --> 02:04:32.923
You see that motherfucker
in the dress department...

1647
02:04:33.007 --> 02:04:34.216
when we about to get a half million dollars.

1648
02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.968
And you don't think nothin'
about him bein' there?

1649
02:04:36.052 --> 02:04:37.010
No. Do they know each other?

1650
02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:39.304
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.

1651
02:04:39.389 --> 02:04:41.974
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen.

1652
02:04:42.058 --> 02:04:45.435
You know all them motherfuckers is crooked
as a barrel of snakes, don't you?

1653
02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.603
Why should l think something's weird...

1654
02:04:46.688 --> 02:04:48.188
if l don't know nothin' about them
knowin' each other?

1655
02:04:48.273 --> 02:04:48.939
I don't wanna hear
no fuckin' excuses, Louis.

1656
02:04:49.023 --> 02:04:50.274
I ain't givin' you excuses.

1657
02:04:50.358 --> 02:04:53.026
But I'm tellin' you— l don't fuckin'—
l'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.

1658
02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:55.279
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason...

1659
02:04:55.363 --> 02:04:57.948
you lost every goddamned cent
l got in the world?

1660
02:04:58.032 --> 02:05:00.701
- Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?

1661
02:05:00.785 --> 02:05:03.036
- You better—
- Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker.

1662
02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:06.123
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.

1663
02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:08.584
You better fuckin' back off, man.

1664
02:05:15.216 --> 02:05:18.969
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1665
02:05:19.053 --> 02:05:21.221
Our ass used to be beautiful.

1666
02:06:05.683 --> 02:06:08.352
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.

1667
02:06:08.436 --> 02:06:11.104
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

1668
02:06:19.572 --> 02:06:22.199
You know, if it's me...

1669
02:06:22.283 --> 02:06:25.535
and I got all that shit hangin' over my head
like you got hangin' over yours...

1670
02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.829
I don't know, I'd go shoppin' later.

1671
02:06:27.914 --> 02:06:30.916
Well, l got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...

1672
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.584
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on—

1673
02:06:32.669 --> 02:06:34.586
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait. Just wait a minute.

1674
02:06:34.671 --> 02:06:38.924
Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?
Let me finish.

1675
02:06:39.008 --> 02:06:43.595
I got there early. The idea was
to try on the suit, see if I liked it.

1676
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:46.390
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and l would put back on my uniform...

1677
02:06:46.474 --> 02:06:49.226
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.

1678
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:53.146
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag
with the $50,000 and go home.

1679
02:06:53.231 --> 02:06:55.482
Yeah, but you didn't do that.

1680
02:06:55.566 --> 02:06:57.901
Because l couldn't. Ray, l swear.

1681
02:06:57.986 --> 02:07:00.737
Melanie burst in. She grabbed the bag.

1682
02:07:00.822 --> 02:07:03.282
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.

1683
02:07:10.039 --> 02:07:12.499
What happened to the bag she gave you?

1684
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:17.045
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.

1685
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:19.131
Ordell probably told her to do it.

1686
02:07:19.215 --> 02:07:21.341
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.

1687
02:07:21.426 --> 02:07:24.344
But I couldn't go after her,
because I was in my fucking underwear.

1688
02:07:24.429 --> 02:07:26.930
And I had to put on this suit because l
could put it on faster than my uniform—

1689
02:07:27.015 --> 02:07:29.891
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- l had to. Ray, I was frantic.

1690
02:07:29.976 --> 02:07:32.686
What was I supposed to do?

1691
02:07:38.735 --> 02:07:41.236
All right, what you do after that?

1692
02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:44.072
I went lookin' for you.
And I went back to the place in the mall...

1693
02:07:44.157 --> 02:07:46.241
where you were before,
but you weren't there.

1694
02:07:46.326 --> 02:07:49.828
What was I supposed to do if something
happens? You didn't tell me how to do that.

1695
02:07:49.912 --> 02:07:53.040
There was a guy with Melanie?

1696
02:07:53.124 --> 02:07:55.042
There was nobody in the fitting room.

1697
02:07:59.714 --> 02:08:01.214
Okay.

1698
02:08:09.223 --> 02:08:11.224
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.

1699
02:08:11.309 --> 02:08:13.769
You're clueless, right?
You've no idea where the 50 grand is?

1700
02:08:13.853 --> 02:08:14.811
I have no idea.

1701
02:08:14.896 --> 02:08:17.481
- None.
- It could've gone here, could've gone there?

1702
02:08:17.565 --> 02:08:21.651
I know nothin'. Not a clue. I don't have
an idea where the motherfuckin' money is.

1703
02:08:21.736 --> 02:08:24.071
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a tiny motherfuckin' idea.

1704
02:08:24.155 --> 02:08:27.032
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy!

1705
02:08:27.825 --> 02:08:31.036
Yeah, put it right there. I'll do it.

1706
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.621
Man.

1707
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:44.716
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.

1708
02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:51.598
I gotta talk to you for a second?

1709
02:09:07.782 --> 02:09:09.282
Fuck.

1710
02:09:24.298 --> 02:09:29.010
Louis Gara's dead.
LAPD found him shot in the car on Ninth.

1711
02:09:29.095 --> 02:09:31.388
And we lost Ordell.

1712
02:09:31.472 --> 02:09:33.723
I thought you were fuckin' watchin' him.

1713
02:09:33.808 --> 02:09:36.977
We were, and we lost him.

1714
02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:40.897
He walked into a strip bar
sometime around 3:30 and never came out.

1715
02:09:40.982 --> 02:09:45.819
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile
and a half from where they found Louis.

1716
02:09:45.903 --> 02:09:48.363
It looks like Louis's buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.

1717
02:09:48.448 --> 02:09:51.783
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.

1718
02:09:51.868 --> 02:09:54.953
We got three murders we can link him to,
and we got you.

1719
02:09:55.997 --> 02:09:57.456
What about me?

1720
02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:58.999
What about you?

1721
02:10:00.877 --> 02:10:03.295
You think I took some of that money?

1722
02:10:03.379 --> 02:10:05.881
Hey, l have no evidence
ofyou doin' anything.

1723
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:10.302
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit
with marked bills.

1724
02:10:10.386 --> 02:10:13.513
I'm glad to see that.
You've been helpin' us out.

1725
02:10:13.598 --> 02:10:16.308
You gave us Melanie. You gave us Louis.

1726
02:10:16.392 --> 02:10:22.105
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.

1727
02:10:22.190 --> 02:10:25.108
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.

1728
02:10:27.528 --> 02:10:30.447
I'll settle for Ordell with marked bills.

1729
02:10:33.451 --> 02:10:35.785
But if there's anything else...

1730
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:40.832
you haven't told me about, you know what,
that's between you and Ordell.

1731
02:10:40.917 --> 02:10:44.044
I just got one thing to say.

1732
02:10:44.128 --> 02:10:47.088
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.

1733
02:10:47.173 --> 02:10:50.926
No, no, no, l done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker.

1734
02:10:51.010 --> 02:10:56.014
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.

1735
02:10:56.098 --> 02:11:00.143
Come on, man, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.

1736
02:11:00.228 --> 02:11:04.648
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein'
who my friends are, motherfucker, right—

1737
02:11:04.732 --> 02:11:08.318
Hello? Hello?

1738
02:11:08.402 --> 02:11:12.322
Motherfucker hung up on me.
You believe that shit?

1739
02:11:12.406 --> 02:11:16.660
Ingrate nigger.
See, you bring a motherfucker up...

1740
02:11:16.744 --> 02:11:20.080
next thing you know they breaking you off
some goddamned disrespect.

1741
02:11:20.164 --> 02:11:23.583
Motherfuck! Shit!

1742
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:27.963
Goddamn, girl. How you live like this?

1743
02:11:28.047 --> 02:11:30.549
- Like what?
- Like this.

1744
02:11:30.633 --> 02:11:33.093
This some repugnant shit.

1745
02:11:35.137 --> 02:11:36.638
Bail bonds.

1746
02:11:36.722 --> 02:11:39.140
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.

1747
02:11:39.225 --> 02:11:42.143
- Well, where he at? Out oftown?
- He's around, man.

1748
02:11:42.228 --> 02:11:44.563
- Well, give me his home number.
- No, I'll give you his beeper number!

1749
02:11:44.647 --> 02:11:46.815
All right.
Break out the beeper number, nigger.

1750
02:11:55.449 --> 02:11:58.868
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.

1751
02:11:58.953 --> 02:12:04.082
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?

1752
02:12:04.166 --> 02:12:07.168
I have your 1 0,000. That's why you called.

1753
02:12:09.005 --> 02:12:13.008
The bond collateral that you put down
on Beaumont Livingston...

1754
02:12:13.092 --> 02:12:15.594
and moved over to Miss Brown, remember?

1755
02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:18.763
Oh, she got off, did she?

1756
02:12:18.848 --> 02:12:22.058
They decided to no-file this morning.

1757
02:12:22.143 --> 02:12:24.436
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.

1758
02:12:29.525 --> 02:12:31.026
You still there?

1759
02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:36.156
Look here, man. I know you helped her.

1760
02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.116
And I know you know what I want.

1761
02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:41.828
And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head...

1762
02:12:41.912 --> 02:12:46.916
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.

1763
02:12:47.001 --> 02:12:50.795
Now, she wanna be my friend, she do that.

1764
02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:53.548
She don't want to be my friend no more...

1765
02:12:53.633 --> 02:12:56.968
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.

1766
02:12:57.053 --> 02:12:59.137
And if she go to the police...

1767
02:12:59.221 --> 02:13:02.891
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.

1768
02:13:02.975 --> 02:13:07.437
And we'll go upstate,
hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.

1769
02:13:07.521 --> 02:13:10.690
And that's a promise.
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

1770
02:13:10.775 --> 02:13:14.277
You tell her that, and I'll call you back.

1771
02:13:17.448 --> 02:13:21.117
You're right. lt was Ordell.

1772
02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:26.039
Ifyou have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?

1773
02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:28.541
Cops can't locate him, huh?

1774
02:13:28.626 --> 02:13:30.877
They don't have your winning personality.

1775
02:13:32.421 --> 02:13:36.508
Sure thing. l don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.

1776
02:13:37.385 --> 02:13:40.053
I think l do. Good enough?

1777
02:13:40.137 --> 02:13:42.055
You bet.

1778
02:13:57.196 --> 02:13:59.656
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on the door
like the goddamned police?

1779
02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:02.283
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.

1780
02:14:02.368 --> 02:14:05.745
You keep fuckin' with me,
you the one gonna be asleep— forever.

1781
02:14:06.914 --> 02:14:08.415
I'm alone.

1782
02:14:08.499 --> 02:14:10.166
Get your ass in the house.

1783
02:14:17.091 --> 02:14:19.050
No, freeze, motherfucker. What you doin'?

1784
02:14:19.135 --> 02:14:22.345
Got your money— your bond refund?

1785
02:14:24.098 --> 02:14:25.390
This all?

1786
02:14:25.474 --> 02:14:27.517
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, motherfucker.

1787
02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:30.562
You know what I mean. You talked to her?

1788
02:14:30.646 --> 02:14:33.064
She wants to give you your money.

1789
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:36.735
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batter-ramming your door down right now.

1790
02:14:36.819 --> 02:14:39.028
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.

1791
02:14:39.113 --> 02:14:41.114
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.

1792
02:14:41.198 --> 02:14:43.116
He finds people that don't wanna be found.

1793
02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.744
Oh, well, bully for that nigger.

1794
02:14:45.828 --> 02:14:47.996
So, she wanna give me my money, huh?

1795
02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.460
Yeah. She wants to give it to you herself,
and she wants to collect her ten percent.

1796
02:14:53.544 --> 02:14:56.755
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.

1797
02:14:56.839 --> 02:14:59.591
Oh, and I wanna hear that shit too.

1798
02:14:59.675 --> 02:15:02.635
Turn around. Put your hands on your head.

1799
02:15:09.393 --> 02:15:12.187
Why don't you tell me why?

1800
02:15:12.271 --> 02:15:15.690
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already
tried to getJackie to go in with her...

1801
02:15:15.775 --> 02:15:18.902
split the half million amongst themselves.

1802
02:15:18.986 --> 02:15:22.655
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.

1803
02:15:24.116 --> 02:15:25.784
And you helped her, didn't you?

1804
02:15:25.868 --> 02:15:28.495
All I did was walk out with it.

1805
02:15:28.579 --> 02:15:32.624
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?

1806
02:15:32.708 --> 02:15:35.084
In a way, yes.

1807
02:15:37.588 --> 02:15:42.383
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.

1808
02:15:42.468 --> 02:15:44.552
Go over there and sit on that couch.

1809
02:15:46.347 --> 02:15:48.973
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know you're here.

1810
02:15:49.058 --> 02:15:50.558
Sit down.

1811
02:15:52.144 --> 02:15:53.603
Place stinks.

1812
02:15:53.687 --> 02:15:55.855
You get used to it.

1813
02:15:57.107 --> 02:15:59.859
- Where my money at?
- My office.

1814
02:15:59.944 --> 02:16:03.071
- Where Jackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.

1815
02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:05.114
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?

1816
02:16:05.199 --> 02:16:08.701
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.

1817
02:16:08.786 --> 02:16:12.288
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.

1818
02:16:12.373 --> 02:16:15.625
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe; she can't.

1819
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:17.627
Call her and give her the combination.

1820
02:16:17.711 --> 02:16:20.088
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got her spooked.

1821
02:16:20.172 --> 02:16:23.633
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.

1822
02:16:23.717 --> 02:16:25.718
Oh, you expect me
to just go walkin' in there?

1823
02:16:25.803 --> 02:16:28.471
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.

1824
02:16:28.556 --> 02:16:30.932
When you told her that
you'd name her as an accessory...

1825
02:16:31.016 --> 02:16:32.517
that scared her more than anything.

1826
02:16:32.601 --> 02:16:34.102
She believed you.

1827
02:16:36.438 --> 02:16:39.148
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?

1828
02:16:39.233 --> 02:16:42.944
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?

1829
02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:46.614
See, I ain't trust Melanie,
either, but l could handle her.

1830
02:16:46.699 --> 02:16:49.450
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.

1831
02:16:51.287 --> 02:16:54.372
And I told that fuckin' Louis
all he had to do was hit her in the mouth.

1832
02:16:54.456 --> 02:16:57.750
But no, he had to shoot her.

1833
02:17:01.964 --> 02:17:04.173
- Jackie's at your office, huh?
- Uh-huh.

1834
02:17:04.258 --> 02:17:07.552
She by herself? That big-ass nigger Winston
ain't there, is he?

1835
02:17:07.636 --> 02:17:09.137
She's all alone.

1836
02:17:10.723 --> 02:17:12.682
All right.

1837
02:17:12.766 --> 02:17:15.435
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.

1838
02:17:16.604 --> 02:17:18.563
She will.

1839
02:17:27.573 --> 02:17:30.575
I'll be here. See you in a bit.

1840
02:18:09.323 --> 02:18:12.575
Goddamn. In all the time I've known her...

1841
02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.328
I ain't never heard her scared like that.

1842
02:18:15.412 --> 02:18:17.997
Usually, she too cool for school.

1843
02:18:18.082 --> 02:18:22.168
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

1844
02:19:10.134 --> 02:19:12.719
I didn't know you liked the Delfonics.

1845
02:19:15.222 --> 02:19:17.223
They're pretty good.

1846
02:20:52.736 --> 02:20:55.655
My money's in that office, right?

1847
02:20:58.075 --> 02:21:01.035
If she start giving me some
bullshit about it ain't there...

1848
02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:03.371
and we gotta go someplace else and get it...

1849
02:21:03.455 --> 02:21:07.625
I'm gonna shoot you in the head
right then and there.

1850
02:21:07.709 --> 02:21:10.920
Then l'm gonna shoot that bitch
in the kneecaps...

1851
02:21:11.004 --> 02:21:13.172
find out where my goddamn money is.

1852
02:21:13.257 --> 02:21:15.967
She gonna tell me too.

1853
02:21:16.051 --> 02:21:19.971
Hey, look at me when I'm
talkin' to you, motherfucker.

1854
02:21:23.392 --> 02:21:25.476
Listen.

1855
02:21:25.561 --> 02:21:30.189
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there...

1856
02:21:30.274 --> 02:21:33.359
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?

1857
02:21:34.361 --> 02:21:35.695
Yeah.

1858
02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:41.868
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out ofthis car, is there?

1859
02:21:41.952 --> 02:21:47.039
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. You sure?

1860
02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:55.339
You better be, motherfucker.

1861
02:21:57.551 --> 02:21:59.051
All right.

1862
02:21:59.887 --> 02:22:01.387
Let's roll.

1863
02:22:13.984 --> 02:22:15.985
You got the key, right?

1864
02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:23.075
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?

1865
02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:25.328
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.

1866
02:22:25.412 --> 02:22:28.456
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.

1867
02:22:34.463 --> 02:22:36.422
Why it so dark in here?

1868
02:22:42.971 --> 02:22:46.182
Say, Jackie. That you?

1869
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.601
Yeah.

1870
02:22:54.733 --> 02:22:56.525
Goddamn, girl.

1871
02:22:56.610 --> 02:22:58.527
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?

1872
02:23:01.573 --> 02:23:05.618
Ray, he's got a gun!

1873
02:23:22.970 --> 02:23:24.512
He dead?

1874
02:23:24.596 --> 02:23:26.097
Yeah, he's dead.

1875
02:23:27.224 --> 02:23:30.309
Does he have the marked bills on him?

1876
02:23:30.394 --> 02:23:33.729
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...

1877
02:23:33.814 --> 02:23:36.899
and maybe another 1 0,000 I gave him.

1878
02:23:36.984 --> 02:23:39.610
Why'd you give him $ 1 0,000?

1879
02:23:39.695 --> 02:23:41.654
Returned a bond collateral.

1880
02:23:41.738 --> 02:23:44.949
Brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.

1881
02:23:45.993 --> 02:23:48.035
Well, how'd you know where he was?

1882
02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:50.204
I found him.

1883
02:23:50.289 --> 02:23:53.249
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's myjob.

1884
02:23:53.333 --> 02:23:57.461
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.

1885
02:23:57.546 --> 02:23:59.213
She said you wanted him.

1886
02:24:01.008 --> 02:24:02.508
Ray?

1887
02:24:04.011 --> 02:24:07.763
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?

1888
02:24:10.267 --> 02:24:14.979
Well, you did. Thanks.

1889
02:24:36.626 --> 02:24:38.169
Knock, knock.

1890
02:24:39.254 --> 02:24:40.755
Hey.

1891
02:24:41.798 --> 02:24:43.716
Hey, you.

1892
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:46.135
I got your package.

1893
02:24:46.219 --> 02:24:49.138
It was fun gettin'
a half million dollars in the mail.

1894
02:24:49.222 --> 02:24:52.600
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?

1895
02:24:52.684 --> 02:24:56.354
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.

1896
02:24:56.438 --> 02:25:00.066
- I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.

1897
02:25:02.486 --> 02:25:04.695
Well, l'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go—

1898
02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:09.408
- That's Ordell's.
- They confiscated everything else.

1899
02:25:09.493 --> 02:25:11.577
Registration was in the glove box.

1900
02:25:11.661 --> 02:25:14.580
Keys were underneath the seat. Hey.

1901
02:25:14.664 --> 02:25:18.584
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?

1902
02:25:18.668 --> 02:25:20.920
Not after they're dead.

1903
02:25:23.882 --> 02:25:26.092
I didn't use you, Max.

1904
02:25:27.844 --> 02:25:29.553
I didn't say you did.

1905
02:25:31.098 --> 02:25:33.265
And I never lied to you.

1906
02:25:33.350 --> 02:25:37.061
- I know that.
- We're partners.

1907
02:25:37.145 --> 02:25:42.108
I'm 56 years old.
I can't blame anybody for anything / do.

1908
02:25:45.278 --> 02:25:47.279
Do you blame yourself for helpin' me?

1909
02:25:47.364 --> 02:25:49.031
No.

1910
02:25:49.116 --> 02:25:52.326
Look, l'd really feel a whole lot better
ifyou took some more money.

1911
02:25:52.411 --> 02:25:56.038
You'll get over that. Where you goin'?

1912
02:25:56.123 --> 02:25:58.958
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?

1913
02:25:59.042 --> 02:26:02.002
Madrid first. Have you been there?

1914
02:26:02.087 --> 02:26:06.132
- I hear they don't eat dinner until midnight.
- You wanna go?

1915
02:26:06.216 --> 02:26:09.468
Thanks, but you have a good time.

1916
02:26:09.553 --> 02:26:11.011
You sure I can't twist your arm?

1917
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:15.224
Thanks for sayin' that, but no.

1918
02:26:15.308 --> 02:26:17.143
Are you scared of me?

1919
02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:22.231
A little bit.

1920
02:27:00.687 --> 02:27:02.354
I'll send you a postcard.

1921
02:27:03.356 --> 02:27:05.441
Will you?

1922
02:27:05.525 --> 02:27:07.985
I sure will, partner.

1923
02:27:26.713 --> 02:27:28.881
You're running a business, Max.

1924
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:32.051
Cherry Bail Bond.

1925
02:27:36.181 --> 02:27:37.932
What is it your son's charged with?

1926
02:27:49.778 --> 02:27:52.821
Yes, that's a very serious offense.

1927
02:27:54.991 --> 02:27:56.909
Is your son still in school?

1928
02:27:58.078 --> 02:28:00.829
Does his father still live in the house?

1929
02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.712
Could l excuse myself? Would you call me
back in about half an hour?

1930
02:28:13.426 --> 02:28:14.927
Yes, thank you.

1931
02:28:17.127 --> 02:28:21.327
