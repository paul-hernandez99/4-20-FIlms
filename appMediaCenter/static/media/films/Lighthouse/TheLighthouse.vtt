1
00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:47.660
Ow.

2
00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:17.511
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

3
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.732
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save our suppliant soul.

4
00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:23.895
To four weeks.

5
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.020
No, sir. Thank you.

6
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.489
It's bad luck to leave
a toast unfinished, lad.

7
00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.363
Oh, meanin'... meanin' no disrespect.

8
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.745
Man what don't drink
best have his reasons.

9
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.245
Uh... Ain't it... I...

10
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.538
I... I understood
it's against regulations, sir...

11
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.629
Did you?

12
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.925
I did, sir. From, uh...
From them's manual.

13
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.295
Didn't picture you a readin' man.

14
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:57.183
Well, I ain't trying for trouble.

15
00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.676
Then you'll do as I say.

16
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.103
That's in your book too.

17
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.848
To four weeks.

18
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.613
Aye. Aye. The cistern needs a-lookin' to.

19
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:57.326
One of your duties, lad.
Or didn't y'read yourself about it?

20
00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:01.952
You'll clean the brass and the clockwork,
and you'll tidy up the quarters after.

21
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.789
And there's well more
to be mended outside.

22
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.911
D'you hear me, lad?

23
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.455
Yes, sir.

24
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.502
Aye, sir!

25
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.001
Aye, sir.

26
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:24.679
When the fog clears,
you'll work through the dog watch.

27
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:28.645
Doggin' it?

28
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.815
I was 'specting I'd get up
to see the lantern.

29
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:32.902
I tend the light.

30
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.240
Well, the rules is alternatin' shifts.

31
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:42.322
It's the mid-watch that's to dread, lad.
My watch, night to morning.

32
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.834
Some new junior man I'm fixed with.

33
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.338
See to your duties. The light is mine.

34
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.074
Son of a bitch!

35
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.160
Shingles.

36
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.327
Tend to 'em after the cistern.

37
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.339
And the lamp, she needs oil.

38
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:07.837
Aye, sir.

39
00:16:58.768 --> 00:16:59.929
Go!

40
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.054
Move it.

41
00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.044
You don't go in there!

42
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.392
- Oil, sir.
- Tired? Use this next time.

43
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.937
Save you a hell of a lot of trouble.

44
00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.226
Catch your breath, lad.

45
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:18.276
I said, catch your breath, lad.

46
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.411
Then bring that drum back down
the ladder well where y'found it.

47
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:29.370
'Less you're fixin'
to burn the whole light down.

48
00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:38.376
Then see to the rest of your duties.
You're behindhand already.

49
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.214
- Aye, sir.
- You're too slow. You a dullard?

50
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.309
No, sir.

51
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.470
Fooled me.

52
00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:04.193
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

53
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:09.323
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.

54
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.210
Still tastes o'the head?

55
00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:28.764
Ah, find some chirk in ye, lad.
Now is the time for gab and chatter.

56
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.932
Y'best be enjoying it.

57
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.681
Come a fortnight,
and the brace of us'll be wantin'

58
00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.354
to be ever silent as the tomb.

59
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.602
I ain't much for talkin'.

60
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.904
Reckon you're the first?

61
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.741
No, sir. I don't.

62
00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.159
Y'ain't.

63
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.533
Y'ain't.

64
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.159
The <i>Chicopee,</i> a fine-un she were.

65
00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:56.461
Clean-built and trig-lookin'.

66
00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:00.416
None more fleet in '64 than she.

67
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.255
We were on the breaks.

68
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.340
A mutiny, it were.

69
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.889
And why, ask ye? Why?

70
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:13.517
What's the terrible part
of a sailor's life, ask ye, lad?

71
00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:17.645
'Tis when the work stops
when you're twixt wind and water.

72
00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:22.400
Doldrums. Doldrums. Eviler than the Devil.

73
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:27.367
Boredom makes men to villains,
and the water goes quick, lad, vanished.

74
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:33.206
The only med'cine is drink.

75
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.289
Keeps them sailors happy,
keeps 'em agreeable,

76
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.957
keeps 'em calm, keeps 'em...

77
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.128
Stupid.

78
00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:50.678
Curse me if there ain't an old tar spirit
somewheres in ye, lad.

79
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:01.897
Out with it, lad.

80
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.237
Uh...

81
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:09.113
What, uh...
What made your last keeper leave?

82
00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:10.739
Him? Me second?

83
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.947
Mm-hmm.

84
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.497
Died.

85
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.826
Went mad, he did.

86
00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:23.132
Ravin' about sirens, merfolk,
bad omens and the like.

87
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:28.887
In the end, weren't no more sense left
in him than an hen's tooth.

88
00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:34.017
He believed that there was
some enchantment in the light.

89
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:40.187
He notioned that St. Elmo
had cast his very fire into it.

90
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.192
Salvation, said he.

91
00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:57.995
Tall tales.

92
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.465
I seen ye sparrin' with a gull.

93
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:08.672
Best leave 'em be.

94
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:12.134
Bad luck to kill a seabird.

95
00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:14.966
More tall tales.

96
00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:19.054
Bad luck to kill a seabird!

97
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:30.777
Pay me no mind, lad.

98
00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:32.529
None.

99
00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:36.037
Fix us up some coffee.

100
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:39.741
Long night ahead.

101
00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.041
Drop o'coffee will do us good.

102
00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:50.630
You've been neglecting your duties, lad!

103
00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.675
Don't deny it!

104
00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:56.678
What do you call that?

105
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.431
- Sir?
- What?

106
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:03.805
I... I mopped and swept twice over, sir.

107
00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:05.103
Ye lyin' dog.

108
00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:10.438
- I swept 'em.
- 'Tis begrimed and bedabbled.

109
00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:13.107
Unwiped, unwashed, and distained.

110
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.606
You get some kinda peart
outta molestin' me?

111
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.941
Come now?

112
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:21.410
I already says...

113
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.325
How dare ye contradict me, y'dog.

114
00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:26.499
Now look here,
I ain't never intended to be no housewife

115
00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:28.368
nor slave in takin' this job.

116
00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:29.790
It ain't right.

117
00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:35.467
These lodgings is more ramshackle
than any shanty boy's camp I ever seen.

118
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.760
The Queen of England's
own fancy housekeeper

119
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:39.345
couldn't even done no better
than what I done,

120
00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:42.466
'cause I tell you, I scrubbed
this here place twice over, sir...

121
00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:44.513
And I say y'did nothin' o'the sort.

122
00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:49.264
And I say y'swab it again,
and y'swab it proper-like this time,

123
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:52.858
and you'll be swabbin' it
ten times more after that.

124
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:56.062
And if I tells ye to pull up and apart

125
00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:58.816
every floorboard and clapboard
of this here house

126
00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:02.110
and scour 'em down with your bare,
bleedin' knuckles, you'll do it!

127
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.073
And if I tells ye to yank out
every single nail

128
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:10.999
from every molderin' nail-hole
and suck off every speck of rust

129
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:15.507
till all them nails sparkle
like a sperm whale's pecker,

130
00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:20.049
and then carpenter the whole light station
back together from scrap,

131
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:22.923
and then do it all over again,
you'll do it!

132
00:27:22.933 --> 00:27:24.765
And by God and by golly,

133
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.097
you'll do it smilin', lad,
'cause you'll like it.

134
00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:29.471
You'll like it 'cause I says you will!

135
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:36.979
Contradict me again,
and I'll dock your wages.

136
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:40.656
D'ye hear me, lad?

137
00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:44.152
Aye, sir.

138
00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:46.454
Ah.

139
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:49.783
Swab, dog. Swab!

140
00:29:08.247 --> 00:29:10.284
Keep 'em steady, lad!

141
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.623
Aye, sir.

142
00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:16.870
Whitewash must be even, lad.
Bright! Shinin'!

143
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.841
Like a silver whorehouse token.
Give them sailors a proper daymark.

144
00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:24.426
They're not going to see it
in a goddamn storm!

145
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:26.970
Keep your temper now, lad.

146
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:31.559
'Tis fine work. And you're makin'
high marks in me logbook.

147
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:32.847
Them's gospel.

148
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.476
I'll drop y'down a few feet.

149
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:39.775
Easy!

150
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.357
Never been in better hands.

151
00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:46.365
Easy!

152
00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:48.325
Quit your flailing, lad.

153
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.028
- I ain't!
- Y'are!

154
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:51.779
- Keep still!
- I am!

155
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:26.694
Git! Git! Git! Git!

156
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:04.026
Thank ye, lad.

157
00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:06.775
Winslow.

158
00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.899
Ephraim Winslow.

159
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:12.910
These last two weeks, I'd...

160
00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.621
I'd like it if you'd call me by my name.

161
00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:17.741
Listen to ye,

162
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:20.667
giving orders, lad.

163
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.421
- Winslow.
- All right, all right.

164
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:27.334
Suits me just as fine, Ephraim Winslow.

165
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:33.431
So, what brung such a one as ye
to this damned rock?

166
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:35.641
Such as what?

167
00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:37.768
Pretty as a picture.

168
00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:41.814
Only joshing, lad, only josh...

169
00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.524
- Winslow.
- Winslow.

170
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:47.187
What brung ye...

171
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.534
...to this rock, Ephraim Winslow?

172
00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:57.906
What were your work afore?

173
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.333
- Timber.
- Timber?

174
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:06.088
Big timber. Up north. Canada ways.

175
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:08.674
- Hudson Bay outfit?
- The same.

176
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:12.717
True what they say?
"Forest as far as the eye can see"?

177
00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:16.174
Yes, sir. Spruce, tamarack, white pine.

178
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:19.309
"Bush," them folk up there call it.

179
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:21.395
Had enough of trees, that it, then?

180
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.847
Yes, sir.

181
00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:24.975
Can't say I blame ye.

182
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.274
I hearn tell about that life. Hard goin'.

183
00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:33.149
Work one man harder
than two horses, they say.

184
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.359
No, thankee.

185
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:42.576
The sea, she's the only situation
wantin' for me.

186
00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:46.505
Miss it?

187
00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:50.466
Ain't nothing what can touch it.

188
00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:53.086
But I can't...

189
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.509
...be draggin' me old stump about.

190
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:58.595
Nay. Not worth the trouble.

191
00:32:59.728 --> 00:33:03.438
Now I'm a wickie and a wickie I is.

192
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.308
And I'm damn-well wedded
to this here light,

193
00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:12.151
and she's been a finer,
truer, quieter wife

194
00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:14.069
than any alive-blooded woman.

195
00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:18.281
You ever married?

196
00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:21.492
Thirteen Christmases at sea...

197
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:24.868
little 'uns at home.

198
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:27.871
She never forgave it.

199
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:32.417
'Tis for the better.

200
00:33:33.803 --> 00:33:38.423
Since we're getting too friendly,
Ephraim Winslow,

201
00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:43.391
tell me, what's a timber man
want with being a wickie?

202
00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:50.894
Not enough quiet for ye up north?

203
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:53.608
Sawdust itching your nethers?

204
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:57.609
Foreman found ye too high-tempered
for carrying an ax?

205
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:03.247
Like you said,
I just had enough of trees, I guess.

206
00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:10.333
Since I left Dad,

207
00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:13.920
I done every kind of work
that can pay a man.

208
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:16.130
Some I ain't near proud of.

209
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:18.137
Drifter, eh?

210
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:19.430
No, just...

211
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:23.259
Can't find a post
I can take a real shine to,

212
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.806
so I keep movin' along.

213
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:27.480
And I ain't the kind to look back
at what's behind him, see.

214
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.598
On the run?

215
00:34:28.692 --> 00:34:33.062
Now look here, ain't nothin' wrong
with a man startin' fresh, startin' new,

216
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:34.278
just lookin' to earn a living.

217
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:35.897
No.

218
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:38.157
Just like any man,

219
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.947
just wanna settle down
quiet-like with some earnings.

220
00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:46.456
I read someplace
that a man could earn 630 or...

221
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:48.959
I read $1,000 a year

222
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:51.545
if he tends a light far off shore.

223
00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:54.089
The further away, the more he earns.

224
00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:59.129
I read that, and hell, I says, work.

225
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:00.925
Save my earnings.

226
00:35:05.729 --> 00:35:08.187
Sometime soon I'll raise my own roof,

227
00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:11.648
somewheres up country,
with no one to tell me what for.

228
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.356
And that's all.

229
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:21.742
Same old borin' story, eh?

230
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.325
Well, you asked.

231
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:36.416
Say, why is it bad luck to kill a gull?

232
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:41.342
In 'em's the souls of sailors
what met their maker.

233
00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:46.100
You a prayin' man, Winslow?

234
00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:50.350
Not as often as I might.

235
00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.941
But I'm God-fearin',
if that's what you're askin'.

236
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:48.551
Shit.

237
00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:34.031
Wind's changed.

238
00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:36.150
Oh. Good riddance.

239
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.995
Oh, don't be so darn foolish.
It's the calm afore the storm, Winslow.

240
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:43.991
She were a gentle westerly wind
you're cursin'.

241
00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:47.871
Only feels roughly 'cause you don't know
nothin' about nothin',

242
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.999
and there ain't no trees on this here rock
like your Hudson Bay bush.

243
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.294
Nor'Easterly wind'll come soon

244
00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:57.170
a-blowin' like Gabriel's horn.

245
00:41:57.682 --> 00:42:00.174
Best board up them signal house winders.

246
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.635
- Aye, sir.
- 'Twill keep steady

247
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:05.304
afore the tender comes in the morn,
I 'spect,

248
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:08.732
but there's dirty weather knockin' about.

249
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:14.446
Somethin' stirring in ye?

250
00:42:15.992 --> 00:42:18.985
You're gettin' off this rock tomorry,
Winslow.

251
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.202
Don't start grudgen me now.

252
00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:24.039
No, sir.

253
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:25.453
Keeping secrets, are ye?

254
00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:31.292
I could just use a hand
with them boards, is all.

255
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:44.639
Pull, Winslow!

256
00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:50.399
Look at 'em.

257
00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:53.268
Better than fin fishin'.

258
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:06.244
Ain't no crime to take a snort now.
A clear night, and our last afore relief.

259
00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:11.375
I ain't never known an inspector
what wouldn't turn a blind eye.

260
00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:15.424
And I won't take no for an answer.

261
00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:27.303
Should pale death and treble dread...

262
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:32.016
Ah, hell. To... to relief.

263
00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:34.017
And how.

264
00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:39.364
Oh!

265
00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.917
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound ♪</i>

266
00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:01.136
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound! ♪</i>

267
00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:03.426

268
00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:05.594

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:08.101

00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:12.356

00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:14.475

273
00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:18.354
...and a pretty lass, she were,
takin' off her bonnet,

274
00:44:18.364 --> 00:44:23.075
but as I says, I'd broke me leg,
and banged meself all up.

275
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:26.070
It was to a nuns' hospital.

276
00:44:26.706 --> 00:44:29.540
All of them nuns
were Catholics, I tell ye.

277
00:44:35.298 --> 00:44:40.760
But I never went to Salem since
without hoping that I should see her,

278
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.760
for beddin' down weren't the same since.

279
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:51.728
You feel shame when you lie with a woman?

280
00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:53.393
I ain't 'shamed of nothing!

281
00:44:57.945 --> 00:44:59.686
Well, I'll say it...

282
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:03.857
I might even miss ye, Ephraim Winslow.

283
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:08.154
You're fastly a true blue wickie

284
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:10.030
in the making, you is.

285
00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:13.200
Thought one night you was bound to
split me skull in twain,

286
00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:14.827
but you're a good-un.

287
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.755
Why, you'll be workin' the lamp
in no time.

288
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:20.920
Why haven't I?

289
00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:23.467
What?

290
00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:25.637
The light.

291
00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:34.563
I'm the keeper of this station, lad.

292
00:45:34.607 --> 00:45:36.724
Some other station, y'can tend the light.

293
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:37.815
The manual says...

294
00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:40.902
- My log is the only book on this rock...
- Since I'm wickie...

295
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.489
I'm the keeper of the light, lad.
I never let no man touch her...

296
00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:47.485
Don't concern yourself
with the beacon, lad!

297
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:48.576
Mine!

298
00:46:00.132 --> 00:46:02.374
Have it your way.

299
00:46:13.562 --> 00:46:14.769
Say, I never...

300
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:18.269
I don't... I don't know your name.

301
00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.559
Wake.

302
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.106
Your Christian name.

303
00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:26.440
Thomas.

304
00:46:29.036 --> 00:46:31.323
- Thomas?
- Aye, Thomas Wake.

305
00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:35.035
Call me Tom.

306
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.503
Well...

307
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:48.845
To my friend Tom.

308
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:53.217
And gettin' off this goddamn rock.

309
00:50:42.665 --> 00:50:44.406
What are y'splittin' your lungs fer?

310
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:46.203
You smell o' shit.

311
00:50:46.252 --> 00:50:48.744
Best swab this mess
afore the tender comes.

312
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:53.999
Do as you're told, lad.
The quarters are dire.

313
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.594
Aye... Aye, sir. Aye.

314
00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:45.884
They didn't come.

315
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.681
The damp's got to the provisions!

316
00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:34.228
What?

317
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.728
The damp's got to the provisions!

318
00:52:56.799 --> 00:53:00.338
The damp's got to the foodstuffs.
The salt cod is out.

319
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:04.300
- Out?
- Blasted. Gone to rot.

320
00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:07.720
- Praised be.
- Will you hear me now?

321
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.768
- Hear what?
- That we best be rationing.

322
00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:14.514
- Rationing?
- Insubordinate again?

323
00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:16.975
It's only been one day.

324
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:18.192
Devil's tail.

325
00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:23.572
Look, maybe the tender did come.
We just missed her, is all.

326
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:25.742
I can take the dory out.

327
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:28.737
Weeks, Winslow. Weeks.

328
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.701
What?

329
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:32.661
What do you mean, what?

330
00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:34.580
- Weeks?
- Weeks. Aye, weeks.

331
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:37.586
We slept in. Dead drunk.

332
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:40.673
It's been weeks ago
since we missed her, Winslow.

333
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:44.544
And I've been askin' ye
to ration for weeks now, too,

334
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:47.423
but you've kept barking at me
like a mad dog

335
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:50.426
sayin' you can take the dory out.

336
00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:53.429
- Now, look here...
- Oh, no. Don't be losing your head now.

337
00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.726
- This ain't funny.
- No, it ain't.

338
00:53:56.316 --> 00:54:00.026
And I ain't want to be stranded here
with some damn lunatic.

339
00:54:02.448 --> 00:54:04.155
Stranded?

340
00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:06.535
That's what I said.

341
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:09.694
Why, I thought... I thought you said
relief was coming.

342
00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:12.530
If we can wait out the storm.

343
00:54:14.126 --> 00:54:16.288
The tender is coming.

344
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:23.258
In '75, <i>Ol' Striker</i> were marooned here
for seven long months, he was.

345
00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:27.926
The storm died on the mainland,
but here, the waters were too rageful

346
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.422
neither to launch nor land.

347
00:54:32.561 --> 00:54:34.268
You're just tryin' to scare me.

348
00:54:34.354 --> 00:54:36.971
Look at ye. Pretendin'.

349
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:42.982
But ye well know your lot.

350
00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:09.633
Dig!

351
00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:13.804
Dig, says I!

352
00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:15.893
Dig!

353
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.266
Dig!

354
00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:24.736
There she lies.

355
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:47.084
Rations.

356
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:51.887
The worst of us
couldn't fend 'gainst the ship rats

357
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:55.224
what gnawed on the soles of our feet.

358
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:03.604
Their legs withered
and turned gangree'nous,

359
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.728
every shade of the peacock's tail.

360
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:12.401
Their gums grew swollen,
the color of bone, then to rot.

361
00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.904
Tarry blood oozed,

362
00:56:15.914 --> 00:56:20.500
teeth droppin' to the deck
with none to hold on to.

363
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.294
"Land ho!" hears I,

364
00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:33.005
but only grass on that island.
So we et upon the grass.

365
00:56:33.098 --> 00:56:38.389
And 'twas that scurvy
what left me locked ever since.

366
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:42.809
I thought you said you'd broke it.

367
00:56:43.442 --> 00:56:44.523
Aye?

368
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:46.143
Your leg.

369
00:56:47.279 --> 00:56:49.566
Catholic nuns and such like.

370
00:56:50.949 --> 00:56:52.406
You must've misheard.

371
00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:05.295
- I told that dumb bastard...
- Yep. Them eaves be gonners.

372
00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:08.210
"Give me your cant hook," I says to him.

373
00:57:08.842 --> 00:57:13.007
But... Foreman Winslow,

374
00:57:13.013 --> 00:57:16.552
that goddamned Canady bastard...

375
00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:19.551
- Winslow?
- ...always callin' me a dog.

376
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:21.018
A filthy dog.

377
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:23.684
- I'll show you who's a dog.
- Winslow.

378
00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:27.400
- What of him?
- Who, Winslow?

379
00:57:28.737 --> 00:57:30.319
The eaves be fallin'...

380
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:33.489
- He's always raggin' on me.
- Ragging?

381
00:57:33.492 --> 00:57:37.862
Like you. Damn fool nonsense.

382
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:40.159
That's the trouble with ye, Winslow.

383
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:45.285
Trouble with you is eatin' grass
without no teeth.

384
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:47.040
Come now?

385
00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:53.589
Your sea matey's teeth had fallen out.

386
00:57:57.766 --> 00:57:59.257
What are ye gettin' at, Winslow?

387
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:03.052
Ah. Well, it just seems powerful hard

388
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:08.729
to eat grass with no teeth.

389
00:58:09.945 --> 00:58:13.359
'Cause goats and sheeps and cows,

390
00:58:13.365 --> 00:58:17.905
well, now, they all got teeth, don't they?

391
00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:24.283
Y'know how y'eat grass without your teeth?

392
00:58:26.044 --> 00:58:27.285
Oblige me.

393
00:58:27.295 --> 00:58:29.708
Ye rip it out and ye swallow it.

394
00:58:33.468 --> 00:58:35.801
"You rip it out and you swallow it."

395
00:58:35.804 --> 00:58:40.970
- Ye rip it out...
- I don't know 'bout that.

396
00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:42.977
Y'don't?

397
00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:44.427
I don't.

398
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.321
What?

399
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:03.746
What?

400
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:08.455
What?

401
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:12.004
What?

402
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:13.881
What?

403
00:59:13.884 --> 00:59:20.736
- What?
- What?

404
00:59:20.849 --> 00:59:22.841
What?

405
00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:25.638
- That's what I mean!
- What?

406
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.387
That's the trouble with you.

407
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:29.559
That's the trouble with ye!

408
00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:30.807
- With you!
- With ye!

409
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:33.522
No! No!

410
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:36.771
I want a steak!

411
00:59:37.199 --> 00:59:39.486
I want a goddamned steak!

412
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:40.817
I...

413
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:43.695
If I had a steak... Oh, boy.

414
00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:46.664
A... A rare, a bloody steak.

415
00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:49.079
If I... If I had a steak,

416
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:51.627
I would fuck it.

417
00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.876
You don't like me cookin'?

418
00:59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.753
Ugh, don't be such an old bitch!

419
01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.928
You're drunk!
You don't know what you're talkin'.

420
01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.599
How could I possibly like
the horseshit you fix us for supper?

421
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.731
You're drunk,
or ye wouldn't be saying that!

422
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.817
Them tin kitchen shanty cooks
gave us fried doughnuts three times a day

423
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.381
- and country ham bigger than your fist.
- You're drunk! You're drunk! You're drunk!

424
01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.613
- I'm drunk? I...
- You heard me!

425
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.907
- You've been drunk...
- Damn ye!

426
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.778
Drunk since I first laid eyes on you.

427
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.204
You're fond of me lobster, ain't ye?

428
01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.198
You're drunker than a Virginy fence.

429
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.702
I seen it. You're fond of me lobster.

430
01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.789
Say it.

431
01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:38.883
Say it.

432
01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.253
Say it!

433
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.887
I don't have to say nothin'.

434
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.135
Damn ye!

435
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.811
Let Neptune strike ye dead, Winslow!

436
01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.727
Hark!

437
01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.818
Hark, Triton, Hark!

438
01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:03.825
Bellow, bid our father, the sea king,

439
01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:08.322
rise from the depths,
full foul in his fury,

440
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:11.950
black waves teeming with salt-foam,

441
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.625
to smother this young mouth
with pungent slime,

442
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:22.673
to choke ye, engorging your organs
till ye turn blue and bloated

443
01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.298
with bilge and brine
and can scream no more.

444
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:31.307
Only when he, crowned in cockle shells

445
01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:36.104
with slithering tentacled tail
and steaming beard,

446
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:40.319
take up his fell, be-finned arm,

447
01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:43.030
his coral-tined trident screeches,

448
01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.650
banshee-like in the tempest,

449
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.824
and plunges right through your gullet,

450
01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:55.331
bursting ye, a bulging bladder no more,

451
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.208
but a blasted bloody film now,

452
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:03.461
a nothing for the harpies
and the souls of dead sailors

453
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.338
to peck and claw and feed upon,

454
01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:11.768
only to be lapped up and swallowed
by the infinite waters

455
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.888
of the dread emperor himself,

456
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.940
forgotten to any man,

457
01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.151
to any time,

458
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:26.650
forgotten to any god or devil,
forgotten even to the sea,

459
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:33.533
for any stuff or part of Winslow,
even any scantling of your soul,

460
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.500
is Winslow no more,

461
01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:41.214
but is now itself the sea.

462
01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.298
All right. Have it your way.

463
01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:52.849
I like your cooking.

464
01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.764
Son of a bitch.

465
01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.568
Queer way to wear your shoes.

466
01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.154
Just didn't wanna wake you, is all.

467
01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.113
It's a long night.

468
01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.873
And such.

469
01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.747
Hmm. The sun is over the yardarm.

470
01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.339
Best find some winks
afore the day draws farther on.

471
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:19.011
Get back to your duties
or I'll give you a real keelhauling.

472
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.233
You ain't even human no more.

473
01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.447
Workin' apart from folks so long.

474
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.320
You're only tolerable when you're drunk.

475
01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.163
Get to work, says I.

476
01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.244
To work!

Get off me! Get off me!

504
01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.434
- Thomas.
- Aye.

505
01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.904
- It's Thomas.
- Aye.

506
01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.366
No, I'm Thomas.

507
01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.570
I'm Thomas. You're Ephraim.

508
01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.664
I lied.

509
01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.293
Well, I'll be scuppered.

510
01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.294
I'm Thomas. Tommy.

511
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:30.586
Tommy? Tommy Winslow.

512
01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.297
No. Tom Howard.

513
01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.008
What's Winslow?

514
01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.893
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

515
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:44.937
Can I trust you?

516
01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.154
Don't be spilling any of your beans to me.

517
01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:50.856
I ain't interested.

518
01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.484
No. It wasn't that way, is all...
Just, see...

519
01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.282
I see what you're fixin' to do.
You get me all liquored up...

520
01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.373
Your guilty conscience
is ever as tiresome-borin'

521
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.662
as any a guilty conscience.

522
01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.161
- Who...
- Worse. Worse.

523
01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.751
It was... it was a drive, see.

524
01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:11.965
It was a log drive,
and he... he's raggin' on me.

525
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.473
No, I see what you're doing.

526
01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.556
Nothing.

527
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.815
Look, Tom, don't be working
to twist words out of my head.

528
01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.058
I ain't.

529
01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:30.062
Um, I can't... I can't do it. I can't...

530
01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.860
Shut up your own rag box.

531
01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:38.321
I trust... I trust... I trust you.

532
01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.617
No.

533
01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:44.330
I... I trust you, Tom.

534
01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.662
You trust me?

535
01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.255
No, I don't trust you at all.

536
01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.985
And I had 'im handy and helpless.

537
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.616
Alone.

538
01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.790
Too far downstream.

539
01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:30.539
And I... I wanted to do 'im in.
I admit I did.

540
01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:35.802
Seein' the back of his head.

541
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.803
One swipe of the cant hook'd be all.

542
01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.810
Uh... It was...

543
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.681
I... I didn't...

544
01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:51.484
I didn't... I did not.

545
01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.987
The day was long as hell on that drive.

546
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.703
I was lead-tired. I admit it.

547
01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:05.616
But I saw him slippin', not me.

548
01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.411
We saw the jam comin'.

549
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.960
I stood and he slipped.

550
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.004
He shouted up.
And I... I just stood there.

551
01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:22.717
"Tom, you dog!"

552
01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.562
I just stood there, is all. Just...

553
01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:33.314
Just stood and watched 'im
get swallowed by them logs.

554
01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.282
And all I could think
when he was done was,

555
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.948
"I... I could use me a smoke."

556
01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.868
That's it.

557
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.625
So, I packed up his kit and fixin's,
as if they was my own and...

558
01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:57.464
Ephraim Winslow, well, now,
he got a spiffy clean slate.

559
01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:01.797
And Thomas Howard, well, he don't.

560
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:04.761
No prospects.

561
01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:11.394
How else am I gonna find respectable work?

562
01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.233
Tom!

563
01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:24.114
Tom!

564
01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:39.001
Why'd y'spill your beans, Tommy?

565
01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:53.515
Why'd y'spill your beans?

566
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.824
Why'd y'spill your beans?

567
01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.859
Don't leave me!

568
01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:06.482
You crazy son of a bitch!
You smashed up the lifeboat!

569
01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.154
You're abandoning your post!

570
01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:22.206
What're you gonna do?
Send for the lighthouse establishment?

571
01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:27.419
Certain, says I. I'll report ye,
I'll bring the inspector up.

572
01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.631
I'll report you! I know what you done.

573
01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:35.932
Who's reportin' who?
Ephraim Winslow? Or Thomas Howard?

574
01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.184
I know what you done.

575
01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.606
You killed your second.

576
01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:45.653
Your one-eyed junior man.

577
01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:51.151
I found him. In the lobster pot.

578
01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.780
Said he went mad?

579
01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:59.581
You made him mad with that charm!

580
01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.371
That scrimshaw trinket.

581
01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:06.792
But I broke it, see. See?

582
01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.801
Now I'm free. I'm free from your designs!

583
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.137
And I got it all figured out,

584
01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:23.142
'cept what's the secret mischief
your keepin' up there!

585
01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:28.070
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Tommy.

586
01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:33.326
Last night you made a confession
'twould make a saint swear.

587
01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.074
I don't have nothin' to confess,

588
01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:40.166
but you, spillin' your beans,
look what it's done to ye.

589
01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.289
It's made ye mad.

590
01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:48.421
And I knew ye was mad
when y'smashed up that lifeboat just now,

591
01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.716
a-chasing me with an ax,
tryin' to kill Ol' Tom.

592
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.340
Don't ye trust me, Tommy?

593
01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:03.056
Better hand me
the dinner knife ye pocketed.

594
01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:04.148
Y'ain't safe with it.

595
01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.283
That's a good lad.

596
01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.744
Them's government property.

597
01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.500
Deducted from your pay.

598
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.137
Look at your shiverin'.

599
01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:38.429
You're so mad, y'know not up from down.

600
01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.814
How long have we been on this rock?

601
01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:47.020
Five weeks?

602
01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.560
Two days?

603
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.525
Where are we?

604
01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:57.486
Help me to recollect,
who are you again, Tommy?

605
01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:01.865
I'm probably
a figment of your imagination.

606
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:06.290
This rock is a figment
of your imagination too.

607
01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:14.003
You're probably wand'rin' through a grove
of tag alders up north in Canady,

608
01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:19.007
like a frostbitten maniac,
talkin' to yourself,

609
01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.510
knee-deep in snow.

610
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.826
I could use me a smoke.

611
01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.334
We're outta drink.

612
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.457
Ooh!

613
01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:29.036
Monkey pump!

614
01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.466
This place is a sty.

615
01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.304
Mornin' to you too.

616
01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.055
I wish I could go for a walk.

617
01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:15.312
Be my guest. You'll get drowned.

618
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.286
Fiery pit.

619
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.090
Ain't there no justice left in this world?

620
01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.600
Thankee.

621
01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:20.478
What's wrong with your hand?

622
01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:26.155
The other one.

623
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.822
Ye hear o' tetanus?

624
01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:34.155
- Tet-a-nus?
- Hmm. Yeah.

625
01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:36.249
It started as a sliver of a cut, is all...

626
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.332
I said I heard of it.

627
01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.748
...from the forestaysail
when we shoved off...

628
01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.337
- Don't you ever shut up?
- ...but come a fortnight,

629
01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.626
- the bosun was a-shakin'.
- Stop.

630
01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:46.967
His jaw locked tighter than an anchor...

631
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.553
Shut your gum, goddamn it!
I can't hear no more!

632
01:27:49.639 --> 01:27:51.551
What were it ye accused me of?

633
01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:54.638
Y'already told me y'had me figgerd.

634
01:27:55.604 --> 01:28:02.101
I'm tired of your damned-fool yarns
and your Cap'n Ahab horseshit.

635
01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:05.019
You sound like a goddamned parody.

636
01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:09.695
Givin' and nagging orders
like a spinster schoolmarm,

637
01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.367
and all the while turning this station

638
01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:13.577
- to the Devil's own rum hole.
- You're makin' a fool of yourself.

639
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.287
Well, it's all horseshit...

640
01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:21.203
your leg, and your sea life, all of it!

641
01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:27.421
And if I hear one more word of horseshit
coming out of your foul, rotten-toothed,

642
01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.885
- smelly old mouth...
- Ye... Damn ye...

643
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.722
Shut up your gum, goddamn it!
I ain't finished yet!

644
01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.638
You think
you're so goddamned high and mighty

645
01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.012
just 'cause
you're a goddamned lighthouse keeper?

646
01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.356
Well, you ain't a captain of no ship
and you never was!

647
01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:46.144
You ain't no general, you ain't no copper,

648
01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.567
you ain't the president,
and you ain't my father!

649
01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.024
And I'm sick of you actin' like you is!

650
01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:58.074
I'm sick of your laughing, your snoring,
and your goddamned farts.

651
01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.575
Your goddamned...

652
01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:03.706
Goddamn your farts!

653
01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:09.338
You smell like piss,
you smell like jism,

654
01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:13.881
like rotten dick, like curdled foreskin,

655
01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:17.717
like hot onions fucked
a farmyard shit house.

656
01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:20.185
And I'm sick of your smell.
I'm sick of it!

657
01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.975
I'm sick of it, you goddamned drunk.

658
01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:25.942
You goddamned no-account,
son-of-a-bitch-bastard liar!

659
01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.310
That's what you are!

660
01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:34.739
You're a goddamned drunken,
horse-shitting, short, shit liar.

661
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.577
A liar!

662
01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.877
Ye have a way with words, Tommy.

663
01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:48.206
Damn you!

664
01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.673
You're relieved of your duties.

665
01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:58.474
No need to tell me, old-timer.

666
01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:12.029
"Assistant slept late."

667
01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.023
"Work below standard."

668
01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.943
"Attitude hostile."

669
01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:21.409
"Assistant missing."

670
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:26.753
"Given to habitual self-abuse
in the supply shed."

671
01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:30.756
"Drunk on duty!"

672
01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:32.420
"Assault!"

673
01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:33.883
"Theft!"

674
01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:38.135
"Recommend severance without pay."

675
01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:41.384
Severance without pay?

676
01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:44.432
Are you trying to ruin me?

677
01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:46.889
I'm a hard worker.

678
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.234
I am. I work as hard as any man.

679
01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.353
- Ye lie, Thomas.
- Stop it!

680
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:56.111
Ye lie to yourself,
but y'ain't have the sauce to see it.

681
01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.403
Please...

682
01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.620
Just let me into the light, old man.

683
01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:06.250
I've learned so much from you.
Just let me show you. Another chance.

684
01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.878
Forgive and forget, I says.

685
01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:11.588
Just let me into that lantern, is all.

686
01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:15.084
Don't make me beg... or I'll beg.

687
01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.007
I'll beg if that's what you want.
I'll beg.

688
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.006
Please.

689
01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:24.682
Please. Please! Please!

690
01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:26.221
Stand down.

691
01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:31.434
You selfish bastard!
Keepin' it all to yourself.

692
01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.109
You left your old lady,
your children, for what? For what?

693
01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:41.737
Look at ye, handsome lad,
with eyes bright as a lady.

694
01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:45.455
Come to this rock playin' the tough.

695
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.084
Ye make me laugh with your false grum.

696
01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:54.048
Ye pretended to some mystery
in your quietudes,

697
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:57.384
but there ain't no mystery.

698
01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:01.930
You're an open book. A picture, says I.

699
01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:07.145
A painted actress
screaming in the footlights,

700
01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:10.891
a bitch what wants to be coveted
for nothin' but being born,

701
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.893
cryin' 'bout the silver spoon
what should've been yours.

702
01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:19.239
Now look at ye cryin'.

703
01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.451
Boo. Boo.

704
01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:24.911
What you gonna do?

705
01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:29.158
Will ye kill me? Will ye?

706
01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:32.336
Will y'kill me like y'done that gull?

707
01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:35.915
- I didn't...
- Liar! Y'murdering dog!

708
01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:41.884
'Twas ye what changed the wind on us.
'Twas ye what damned us, dog. 'Twas ye!

709
01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:46.308
Will y'do what y'wish
y'done to Ol' Winslow?

710
01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:49.600
Will ye best me then?
For Winslow were right.

711
01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:54.818
Thomas, you're a dog. A filthy dog! A dog!

712
01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:08.037
Git down!

713
01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:13.328
Let go of me!

714
01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:16.436
You're killing me!

715
01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.981
Bark.

716
01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.358
Bark, boy.

717
01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:07.692
Bark, laddie.

718
01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:10.785
Bark.

719
01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:15.783
Woof.

720
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.498
Ain't ye never been to sea before?

721
01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:21.000
Bark, I says. Bark!

722
01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:24.045
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

723
01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.543
Bark, laddie!

724
01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:29.138
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

725
01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.132
- Now, there's a good boy.
- Ruff!

726
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:36.304
- There's a good dog.
- Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

727
01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:38.976
Ruff!

728
01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:41.437
Now roll over.

729
01:35:58.544 --> 01:35:59.705
Come on.

730
01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:02.212
Come on.

731
01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.511
Git!

732
01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.353
Come on.

733
01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:38.115
Get up here.

734
01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:59.015
Good boy. Good boy.

735
01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:02.648
Now you get in there, where you belong.

736
01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:06.359
You do as I say, dog.

737
01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.983
There's my good lad.

738
01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:31.589
Ye wish to see
what's in the lantern?

739
01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.051
So did me last assistant.

740
01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:36.348
Shut up, old dog!

741
01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:39.722
Polish your brasswork.

742
01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:47.314
O what Protean forms swim up
from men's minds,

743
01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.064
and melt in hot Promethean plunder,

744
01:37:51.157 --> 01:37:55.117
scorching eyes,
with divine shames and horror...

745
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:01.832
And casting them down to Davy Jones.

746
01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:05.669
The others, still blind,

747
01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.755
yet in it see

748
01:38:08.758 --> 01:38:13.173
all the divine graces

749
01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:18.724
and to Fiddler's Green sent,

750
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:25.565
where no man is suffered to want or toil,
but is...

751
01:38:27.193 --> 01:38:28.400
ancient...

752
01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:32.813
mutable and unchanging...

753
01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.992
as the she who girdles 'round the globe.

754
01:38:41.874 --> 01:38:43.081
Them's truth.

755
01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:46.202
You'll be punished.

756
01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:17.884
The light belongs to me!

757
01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:15.310
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

758
01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:21.736
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.
