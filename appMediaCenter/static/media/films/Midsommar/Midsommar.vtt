00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.287
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

3
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.787
<i>...the Ardor residence.</i>

4
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.299
<i>Please leave a message</i>

5
00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:54.457
<i>after the tone.</i>

6
00:01:57.426 --> 00:01:59.796
<i>Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

7
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.165
<i>Uh, I'm sorry
to be calling so late.</i>

8
00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.035
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>

9
00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:06.970
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

10
00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.339
<i>Um...</i>

11
00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:10.741
<i>Listen, I got kind of
a scary email from Terri</i>

12
00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:13.410
<i>and she hasn't
been responding.</i>

13
00:02:13.543 --> 00:02:15.545
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

14
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.548
<i>But, uh, yeah,
it sounds like you guys</i>

15
00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:21.618
<i>have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

16
00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:24.488
<i>Anyway, uh, I just got
a little worried.</i>

17
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.291
<i>So, um, if you can call
when you can,</i>

18
00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:28.825
<i>and of course, you know I'm...
I'm always here</i>

19
00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.427
<i>if you need anything,</i>

20
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.996
<i>of course.</i>

21
00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.203
Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.

22
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.044
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey, sweetie.

23
00:03:51.177 --> 00:03:52.312
What are you up to?

24
00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:56.282
<i>Um, just smoked
some resin with Mark</i>

25
00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:57.616
<i>and now we're getting pizza.</i>

26
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.252
Oh, nice.

27
00:03:59.386 --> 00:04:01.489
<i>- Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.
- Yeah, um...</i>

28
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.425
<i>He's saying "hi"
right now, over and over.</i>

29
00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.694
- Hi, Mark.
- <i>Hi, Mark.</i>

30
00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:12.833
So, I was calling
just to see if you...

31
00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.235
You still wanted
to hang out later?

32
00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.304
<i>Oh.</i>

33
00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:21.675
<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

34
00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.677
I mean, not...
Not concretely,

35
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:25.912
but, um,
I just wanted to see...

36
00:04:26.047 --> 00:04:29.850
<i>Um... Well... Okay.</i>

37
00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:32.553
<i>Yeah, I should be able
to swing by.</i>

38
00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:34.721
- Cool.
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

39
00:04:39.093 --> 00:04:41.129
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

40
00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:45.132
Um, well...

41
00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:48.736
Uh, yeah, um...

42
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:53.841
I emailed her three times

43
00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:55.210
and still no response

44
00:04:55.343 --> 00:04:58.113
so I'm getting
a little bit nervous, so...

45
00:04:58.246 --> 00:05:00.882
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

46
00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:02.817
Yeah, probably...

47
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.162
<i>She does this
every other day, Dani.</i>

48
00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:06.321
<i>And only because you let her.</i>

49
00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.135
Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

50
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.959
<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babes.</i>

51
00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:13.361
<i>You go straight
to crisis mode.</i>

52
00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:15.831
Well, she's my sister

53
00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:19.469
and even you said that
this email seemed different.

54
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:21.669
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

55
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:24.474
<i>Is it though, really?</i>

56
00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.975
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

57
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.745
<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

58
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:32.348
Yeah, you're right.

59
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:35.418
You are right, yeah, I know.

60
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:36.886
<i>I mean, the more you respond</i>

61
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.555
<i>the more she's encouraged
to keep...</i>

62
00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:40.366
No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

63
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.391
I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.

64
00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:46.796
I'm very lucky to have you.

65
00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:49.266
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

66
00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.100
I love you.

67
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:55.071
<i>I love you.</i>

68
00:05:58.175 --> 00:06:00.276
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

69
00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.613
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

70
00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:04.647
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

71
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.484
Okay, I love you.

72
00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:09.153
- <i>All right.</i>
- Bye.

73
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.367
It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

74
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.271
he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

75
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.895
<i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

76
00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:19.329
What if
I've scared him, though?

77
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:20.906
I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

78
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.065
<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

79
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.635
I'm always leaning on him!

80
00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:25.247
Like, I even called him today
in tears

81
00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:27.671
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary email.

82
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.007
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

83
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.010
What if I'm scaring him off?

84
00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.379
<i>What did your sister write?</i>

85
00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:35.580
Mmm.

86
00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:36.948
Just some ominous bullshit

87
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:38.882
like she always does
and it's torture.

88
00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:40.884
And I lean on him constantly
for support.

89
00:06:41.018 --> 00:06:43.354
Like, what if
I have overwhelmed him

90
00:06:43.488 --> 00:06:45.523
and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

91
00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:48.192
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

92
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:52.030
No, not if I...
I went too far, if I leaned too much.

93
00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:54.365
<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

94
00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:56.301
Yeah, but what if
I need him too often

95
00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:57.669
and it becomes a chore?

96
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.870
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

97
00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:01.444
<i>Because it shouldn't
ever be a chore.</i>

98
00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.241
<i>Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?</i>

99
00:07:03.374 --> 00:07:04.852
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me
for anything.

100
00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:06.036
I've never even seen him cry,

101
00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:08.079
so I'm the only one
that's leaning.

102
00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:10.157
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

103
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:12.318
<i>The only one
making yourself vulnerable.</i>

104
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.851
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

105
00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:15.787
Dude.

106
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.189
You have gotta
get off the fence with this.

107
00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:22.170
What if
I regret it later

108
00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:23.462
and I can't get her back?

109
00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:25.831
- You don't want her back!
- But I might.

110
00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:28.166
Okay, well, then you can

111
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.735
bitch to us about how much
you regret it for that day

112
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:32.438
and then
we'll remind you again

113
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:34.149
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

114
00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:35.575
for, like, a year now

115
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.977
and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

116
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.121
and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

117
00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:42.449
Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

118
00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:44.317
that is playing out
this particular drama

119
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.952
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

120
00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:51.258
What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

121
00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:53.426
Well, I dunno,
your prospectus, maybe?

122
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.828
Your PhD...

123
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.862
Wow, okay,
thanks for the psychoanalysis.

124
00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:58.274
It's not
about academics, Josh.

125
00:07:58.298 --> 00:07:59.733
I'm just trying
to get you focused.

126
00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:01.801
- Change?
- Um, that's for you.

127
00:08:04.937 --> 00:08:07.540
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

128
00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:09.252
And don't forget about
all the Swedish women

129
00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:10.645
you can impregnate in June.

130
00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:12.097
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget about

131
00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.665
- all the Swedish milkmaids.
- Mmm-hmm.

132
00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:17.284
That's not her again.

133
00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:19.953
Seriously?

134
00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:22.657
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.600
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

136
00:08:24.624 --> 00:08:26.744
Oh, so then she should call
her therapist and not you.

137
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.028
It's literally abuse.

138
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:29.597
- She's abusing you.
- 'Scuse me.

139
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.666
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

140
00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:33.333
Okay, excuse me, guys.

141
00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:34.934
- Well...
- Great.

142
00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.278
- Hey.
<i>- No.</i>

143
00:08:44.412 --> 00:08:48.582
- Dani, babe?
- <i>Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

144
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:32.016
No, no, no, no, no!

145
00:13:13.087 --> 00:13:14.388
Hey, babe.

146
00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:16.290
How you feeling?

147
00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:24.833
I'm up.

148
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.006
Where you going?

149
00:13:30.138 --> 00:13:32.975
I was just gonna go
to that party for 45 minutes.

150
00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:34.476
But, you just keep sleeping.

151
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.377
No.

152
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.179
No, I'll come with you.

153
00:13:37.312 --> 00:13:38.512
You sure you got enough sleep?

154
00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:40.616
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

155
00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:46.031
Yeah, I'm fucking
dreading the summer.

156
00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:47.322
Stuck in a shit-ass hole

157
00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:49.726
listening to my step-mom
fuck my dad all day.

158
00:13:49.858 --> 00:13:52.194
I'll listen to
your step-mom fuck your dad.

159
00:13:52.327 --> 00:13:54.463
Hey, Josh, you, uh,
going to Europe?

160
00:13:54.596 --> 00:13:56.164
Uh, yeah, yeah,
for my thesis,

161
00:13:56.298 --> 00:13:58.501
you know, we all are.

162
00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:00.837
Oh, you're all going?

163
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.007
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Halsingland.

164
00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:05.441
Sweden.

165
00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:08.779
Oh, any occasion,
or is it just for fun?

166
00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:12.315
Uh, well, I'm...
I'm doing my research

167
00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:14.017
on European
midsummer traditions,

168
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.718
these guys
are just tagging along.

169
00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:17.520
Mr. Pelle's invited us to

170
00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:19.856
an authentic hippie midsummer
at his yodeling farm.

171
00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.460
Oh, yeah?

172
00:14:25.763 --> 00:14:27.831
I mean,
we were talking about it.

173
00:14:27.965 --> 00:14:29.532
We were thinking about it.

174
00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:32.903
For when?

175
00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:34.838
Uh...

176
00:14:34.972 --> 00:14:36.573
Mid-June to mid-July.

177
00:14:36.707 --> 00:14:38.741
Yeah, two weeks from now?

178
00:14:38.876 --> 00:14:40.276
Yeah.

179
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.780
I mean, that's if we even go.

180
00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:45.249
I'm probably
not gonna go, but...

181
00:14:45.382 --> 00:14:46.918
Yeah, we were talking
about it.

182
00:15:28.126 --> 00:15:29.494
You okay?

183
00:15:30.228 --> 00:15:31.897
Mmm-hmm. Fine.

184
00:15:37.068 --> 00:15:38.937
That was just really weird.

185
00:15:40.238 --> 00:15:41.539
What was?

186
00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.414
The...

187
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:51.817
Sweden.

188
00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:55.453
I had no idea.

189
00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:58.758
Well, what do you mean?

190
00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.893
'Cause I told you
I wanted to go.

191
00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:06.966
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

192
00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.337
I just decided today.

193
00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.373
I wasn't keeping it from you.

194
00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:16.609
You already have a ticket.

195
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:21.782
I'm sorry?

196
00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.556
Okay, well, just

197
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.325
imagine if you were at a party
and someone said,

198
00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.493
"Hey, what're you doing
for summer?"

199
00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.596
And then my friend said,

200
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.200
"Oh, we're going to China
for three months

201
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.576
"and we're leaving
in two weeks..."

202
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.979
It's Sweden,
for a month and a half.

203
00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.445
And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

204
00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.671
Okay.

205
00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.540
I told you
I wanted to go to Sweden.

206
00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.642
No, you said
it would be cool to go.

207
00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:50.211
Yeah, and then
I got the opportunity

208
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.021
- and I decided to do it.
- Look, I don't mind you going.

209
00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:54.314
I just wish you would've
told me, that's all.

210
00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:56.550
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

211
00:16:57.584 --> 00:16:59.487
You didn't apologize,
you said sorry,

212
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.588
which sounds more like,
"Too bad."

213
00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:07.762
Maybe I should just go home.

214
00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:09.597
What? No, no.

215
00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:12.599
I'm just trying to understand.

216
00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:13.844
And I'm trying to apologize.

217
00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:15.536
And I don't need an apology.

218
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.839
I don't, I just wanted to talk
about it, that's all.

219
00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:22.252
I really think
I should just leave.

220
00:17:22.276 --> 00:17:23.945
No, no, no, no.

221
00:17:24.078 --> 00:17:25.656
Please, please, please. I'm not...
I'm not trying to attack you.

222
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.991
- It really feels like you are.
- I'm not.

223
00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:28.482
Well, then...
Well, then I'm sorry.

224
00:17:28.617 --> 00:17:31.853
I'm... I just got confused.
I'm sorry, I...

225
00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:34.223
Hey, please, c'mon,
can you come?

226
00:17:34.355 --> 00:17:35.399
- Just can you come and sit...
- Stop.

227
00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:36.557
...with me, please?

228
00:17:36.692 --> 00:17:38.894
Please, and we can
talk about it.

229
00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:41.796
Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

230
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.631
But I'm fine,
I think it's great

231
00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:45.601
that you're going to Sweden,
I do.

232
00:17:46.235 --> 00:17:47.603
I think it's amazing.

233
00:17:48.437 --> 00:17:50.605
Are you going for your thesis?

234
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.710
I don't know
what my thesis is.

235
00:17:54.843 --> 00:17:57.579
I know and it...
It can... It will...

236
00:17:59.348 --> 00:18:01.617
It can be inspiring, right?

237
00:18:03.452 --> 00:18:04.786
Right?

238
00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:10.926
In Stockholm, are there
any, like, meatball sex clubs

239
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.363
we should hit up
before we head north?

240
00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:15.164
No, we're going
straight north.

241
00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:18.346
Not straight, straight,
though, right?

242
00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:19.477
We gotta go through Stockholm

243
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:20.569
to get there.

244
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:21.780
No, it's
the opposite direction.

245
00:18:21.804 --> 00:18:23.806
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

246
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.276
Guys, it's Dani.

247
00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:26.809
She's coming up.

248
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.746
Okay.

249
00:18:29.879 --> 00:18:32.749
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

250
00:18:40.823 --> 00:18:43.693
Um,
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

251
00:18:44.261 --> 00:18:46.230
So you guys know.

252
00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:47.697
She's not actually gonna come,

253
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.500
but I invited her
just to not make it weird.

254
00:18:52.136 --> 00:18:54.538
- You invited her to...
- Mmm-hmm.

255
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:56.873
But she's not coming.

256
00:18:58.375 --> 00:18:59.743
She doesn't want to?

257
00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:04.581
I invited her
and she accepted,

258
00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:07.617
but she's not actually coming
to Sweden.

259
00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:09.520
Okay.

260
00:19:11.989 --> 00:19:14.059
Guys, you know
what she's been going through.

261
00:19:15.226 --> 00:19:18.562
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

262
00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:20.098
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

263
00:19:20.231 --> 00:19:22.109
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

264
00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:23.768
Okay, that's great.

265
00:19:25.003 --> 00:19:28.472
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

266
00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:29.884
and you all know
that she's coming...

267
00:19:29.908 --> 00:19:31.142
Agreed?

268
00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:32.445
Yep.

269
00:19:32.577 --> 00:19:34.179
- Hey!
- Hey, babe!

270
00:19:35.413 --> 00:19:36.580
Hey, guys.

271
00:19:36.714 --> 00:19:38.482
- Hey.
- Yo.

272
00:19:38.616 --> 00:19:40.051
How's it going?

273
00:19:41.686 --> 00:19:42.921
We're chilling.

274
00:19:43.055 --> 00:19:44.190
Nice.

275
00:19:46.658 --> 00:19:48.660
So, Sweden.

276
00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:50.273
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

277
00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:52.331
I mean, I...

278
00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:53.733
I guess so,

279
00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:55.786
if that's not completely
ruining you guys' plans.

280
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.036
- Oh, no, no.
- No, not at all.

281
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:04.709
Uh, Christian,
can I get you to take a look

282
00:20:04.843 --> 00:20:06.644
at this paragraph real quick?

283
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.949
Uh, yeah, sure.

284
00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:12.818
- I'll be back.
- Mmm-hmm.

285
00:20:18.024 --> 00:20:19.792
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

286
00:20:28.368 --> 00:20:30.137
What were you drawing?

287
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.505
Uh, just the table.

288
00:20:31.637 --> 00:20:32.872
Oh.

289
00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:35.306
How have you been?

290
00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:37.210
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

291
00:20:37.344 --> 00:20:40.213
Survived finals, you know.

292
00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:42.848
- And you?
- Uh...

293
00:20:42.982 --> 00:20:44.284
I didn't quite finish,

294
00:20:44.418 --> 00:20:48.021
but they're giving me
a break this year.

295
00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:50.425
Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

296
00:20:50.557 --> 00:20:51.824
It's, uh...

297
00:20:51.957 --> 00:20:53.860
How did you like
the Anthropology department?

298
00:20:54.394 --> 00:20:55.695
I like it, yeah.

299
00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:57.831
Not as much as
this one maybe, but...

300
00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:02.202
You're doing psychiatry,
right?

301
00:21:02.335 --> 00:21:03.603
Uh, psychology, yeah.

302
00:21:03.737 --> 00:21:06.106
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

303
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.409
Yeah, also that funny look
in your eye.

304
00:21:10.178 --> 00:21:12.145
So you're coming
to Halsingland?

305
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:13.481
I guess so, yeah.

306
00:21:13.613 --> 00:21:17.018
And, um, we'll actually
be arriving on my birthday.

307
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:19.620
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you!

308
00:21:19.754 --> 00:21:24.525
Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

309
00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.194
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy

310
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:28.062
nine-day festival
my family's doing.

311
00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:30.131
- Lots of pageantry...
- Uh-huh.

312
00:21:30.264 --> 00:21:32.033
...special ceremonies,
and dressing up.

313
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.634
That sounds fun.

314
00:21:33.768 --> 00:21:35.571
It'll probably seem
very silly.

315
00:21:35.703 --> 00:21:37.939
But, it's like theater.

316
00:21:38.073 --> 00:21:39.274
Yeah, Christian says you're...

317
00:21:39.408 --> 00:21:42.143
You're from
like a commune, right?

318
00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:44.379
Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

319
00:21:45.414 --> 00:21:47.316
Here. I'll show you.

320
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.323
Oh, wow.

321
00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:56.859
I see what you mean
about the pageantry.

322
00:21:56.992 --> 00:21:58.337
Yeah, we make
those clothes special

323
00:21:58.361 --> 00:22:00.429
for every
winter and summer solstice.

324
00:22:00.562 --> 00:22:03.532
I mean, everybody sort of
does everything together.

325
00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:05.134
That's an interesting symbol.

326
00:22:05.267 --> 00:22:08.537
Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

327
00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:10.839
Whoa, who's that one?

328
00:22:10.973 --> 00:22:13.409
- That's last year's May Queen.
- Uh-huh.

329
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.644
Beautiful.

330
00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:19.648
You know, I'm very, very glad
you're coming.

331
00:22:21.183 --> 00:22:24.087
I... I think
it's very good you're coming.

332
00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.189
Thank you.

333
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.790
Also, I...

334
00:22:28.924 --> 00:22:30.560
I never had the chance
to tell you...

335
00:22:30.692 --> 00:22:33.229
- Mmm.
- ...but I was...

336
00:22:33.363 --> 00:22:36.900
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

337
00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:40.370
- Oh.
- What happened, I mean,

338
00:22:40.503 --> 00:22:42.205
I can't even imagine.

339
00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:43.907
I mean...

340
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.675
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

341
00:22:45.808 --> 00:22:47.343
I kind of have some idea.

342
00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:48.945
- I'm sorry.
- No!

343
00:22:49.078 --> 00:22:50.446
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

344
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:53.016
I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

345
00:23:43.335 --> 00:23:45.169
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

346
00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:48.373
<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

347
00:23:57.182 --> 00:24:00.218
Oh, my God, the women here.

348
00:24:00.352 --> 00:24:02.255
What is it
that makes them hotter?

349
00:24:02.388 --> 00:24:04.108
The Vikings
grabbed all the best babes

350
00:24:04.155 --> 00:24:07.425
from other countries
and dragged them over.

351
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.894
Christian, you can do
your thesis on that.

352
00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:11.497
How long is the drive?

353
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:12.665
About four hours.

354
00:24:12.798 --> 00:24:14.799
Oh, my God.

355
00:25:21.568 --> 00:25:23.970
Okay,
this is the first stop.

356
00:25:24.104 --> 00:25:25.205
This is it?

357
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.308
Not quite, almost.

358
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.581
Pelle!

359
00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:35.450
- Hey!
- Hey!

360
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.023
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

361
00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:37.952
Hey, guys,
so these are younger people

362
00:25:38.086 --> 00:25:39.420
from my village.

363
00:25:39.554 --> 00:25:41.522
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

364
00:25:41.955 --> 00:25:43.257
Come on over.

365
00:25:44.827 --> 00:25:46.227
Hey!

366
00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:48.530
These are my friends
from America.

367
00:25:50.864 --> 00:25:53.000
- Oh, dude.
- Hey.

368
00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:54.436
Just fucking walk.

369
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.013
Yeah, dude,
there's so many bugs.

370
00:25:56.037 --> 00:25:57.606
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mmm.

371
00:26:04.078 --> 00:26:05.114
Okay, so this is, uh...

372
00:26:05.247 --> 00:26:06.615
- Mark, Dani...
- Hi.

373
00:26:06.749 --> 00:26:09.350
Christian and Josh.

374
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:11.152
What?

375
00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:13.989
Give me just one second.

376
00:26:14.123 --> 00:26:15.491
You think
he knows that guy?

377
00:26:15.624 --> 00:26:16.624
He sounded mad.

378
00:26:27.469 --> 00:26:28.570
That must be good.

379
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.546
Here! Come on over,
come on over.

380
00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:39.481
This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

381
00:26:39.616 --> 00:26:40.616
Christian, Dani,

382
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:42.050
- Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

383
00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:43.686
Meet my brother, Ingemar.

384
00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.723
Uh, best friends since
we were babies, actually.

385
00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:47.022
Yeah.

386
00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:50.226
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

387
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.561
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

388
00:26:51.694 --> 00:26:53.663
Awesome! And say hello
to my friends.

389
00:26:53.798 --> 00:26:55.198
This is Simon and Connie

390
00:26:55.331 --> 00:26:56.833
- from London.
- How's it going?

391
00:26:56.965 --> 00:26:58.967
- Hi.
- Simon, this is Pelle...

392
00:26:59.102 --> 00:27:01.137
And these are all the names

393
00:27:01.271 --> 00:27:02.673
I just learned
two seconds ago.

394
00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:06.109
Perfect timing, by the way,

395
00:27:06.242 --> 00:27:08.913
we... We just took these
five minutes ago.

396
00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:11.080
Haven't even started
coming up yet.

397
00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:13.350
Oh, shit!

398
00:27:13.484 --> 00:27:16.286
Do you guys wanna take it now
or should we settle in first?

399
00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:17.864
Fuck it,
let's just take it now, right?

400
00:27:17.888 --> 00:27:19.222
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

401
00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:21.125
Uh, you know what,

402
00:27:21.258 --> 00:27:24.094
I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

403
00:27:24.228 --> 00:27:26.697
- Uh, yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

404
00:27:26.831 --> 00:27:28.365
And listen,
if you're feeling uneasy,

405
00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:30.201
you don't have
to take them at all.

406
00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:32.771
No. No, no, no. I just...
I wanna feel settled first.

407
00:27:32.904 --> 00:27:34.338
- Okay.
- Okay.

408
00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:37.308
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

409
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.742
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

410
00:27:38.877 --> 00:27:40.511
I want us to come up together.

411
00:27:40.645 --> 00:27:42.781
- Ready?
- Okay?

412
00:27:42.914 --> 00:27:45.649
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

413
00:27:47.652 --> 00:27:49.821
Dude, we can't take them
at different times,

414
00:27:49.955 --> 00:27:51.523
they'll be
totally separate trips.

415
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:55.159
You wanna wait for us then?

416
00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:02.678
You know what,
it's fine, it's fine.

417
00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:04.377
- Babe... Babe, no.
- I'm ready.

418
00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:05.780
- No, it's okay,
- Don't feel rushed.

419
00:28:05.804 --> 00:28:07.639
I don't, I don't.
It's fine, I'm ready.

420
00:28:09.107 --> 00:28:10.542
Are you sure?

421
00:28:12.277 --> 00:28:14.346
Yes, Mark, thank you.

422
00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:16.147
- They've made mushroom tea.
- Mmm-hmm.

423
00:28:16.281 --> 00:28:17.682
If you prefer
against the taste.

424
00:28:17.817 --> 00:28:20.151
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll try that, thank you.

425
00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:21.621
- Ingemar? Ingemar?
- Ingemar.

426
00:28:21.754 --> 00:28:23.655
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
- Perfect.

427
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.358
Don't let Mark be the one

428
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:27.651
- to pressure you.
- He's not.

429
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.562
- Of all people.
- He's not, he's not.

430
00:28:29.695 --> 00:28:31.106
It will... It will get
complicated otherwise, it's fine.

431
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.697
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

432
00:28:32.832 --> 00:28:34.232
- There you go.
- Ooh.

433
00:28:34.366 --> 00:28:35.401
Thanks, dude.

434
00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:37.203
Okay,
here we go then.

435
00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:38.747
- Think happy thoughts!
- Are you sure about this?

436
00:28:38.771 --> 00:28:40.974
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers!

437
00:28:42.775 --> 00:28:44.710
- All right.
- Yeah?

438
00:28:44.844 --> 00:28:46.145
Are you sure about this?

439
00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:48.247
I think it's gonna be fun.

440
00:28:48.381 --> 00:28:50.417
- We're in?
- Yep, go.

441
00:28:55.454 --> 00:28:57.089
What time is it?

442
00:28:57.223 --> 00:29:00.360
It's 9:00 p.m.

443
00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:03.697
What do you mean?

444
00:29:05.298 --> 00:29:06.733
What do you mean?

445
00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:10.237
That can't be right!
The sky is blue!

446
00:29:11.203 --> 00:29:13.306
It's fine, it's Sweden.

447
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.376
That's not fine!
Why is it like that?

448
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.313
It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

449
00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:21.648
That feels wrong,
I don't like that!

450
00:29:21.782 --> 00:29:23.884
I promise you,
it's okay.

451
00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:25.252
I'm not okay.

452
00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:27.055
Oh, fuck,
it's a new person.

453
00:29:27.187 --> 00:29:28.288
What?

454
00:29:28.422 --> 00:29:30.691
I don't want new people
right now.

455
00:29:30.824 --> 00:29:33.627
No,
new people are good, Mark.

456
00:29:34.762 --> 00:29:36.096
Hi, hi!

457
00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:40.466
I'm just gonna lay down, okay?

458
00:29:40.534 --> 00:29:41.936
Yeah, do that.

459
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.137
Everybody else lay down.

460
00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.343
Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

461
00:29:52.413 --> 00:29:54.415
Josh, can you lie down,
please?

462
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.786
Can you feel that?

463
00:29:58.385 --> 00:29:59.754
The energy.

464
00:29:59.887 --> 00:30:01.322
Coming up from the earth.

465
00:30:15.337 --> 00:30:17.107
Look!

466
00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:19.641
The trees too,
they're breathing.

467
00:30:26.482 --> 00:30:28.917
Nature just knows
instinctively

468
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.886
how to stay in harmony.

469
00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:36.593
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

470
00:30:43.933 --> 00:30:46.368
You guys are like my family.

471
00:30:49.238 --> 00:30:51.941
You're like my real,
actual family.

472
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.378
Dani?

473
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.415
Sorry.

474
00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:02.619
Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

475
00:31:02.752 --> 00:31:04.387
I can walk, too.

476
00:31:04.521 --> 00:31:07.157
No, I'm good.

477
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.528
No, no, no, no.

478
00:31:12.362 --> 00:31:13.998
Don't think that. You're fine.

479
00:31:14.131 --> 00:31:15.532
It's almost your birthday.

480
00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:19.170
You're okay, you're fine.
You're fine.

481
00:31:28.611 --> 00:31:31.247
Stop it! I'm fine.

482
00:31:31.382 --> 00:31:32.983
Hey, Dani!

483
00:31:35.786 --> 00:31:36.987
How are you?

484
00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:39.957
They were laughing at me.

485
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:43.294
What? No, no, no,
I'm sure they weren't.

486
00:31:44.095 --> 00:31:45.629
They've been laughing.

487
00:31:46.397 --> 00:31:48.399
Want to come meet my friends?

488
00:31:51.302 --> 00:31:54.905
Thank you.
I'm sorry, thank you.

489
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:04.582
Stop it! Stop it, fuck!

490
00:32:07.986 --> 00:32:11.456
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

491
00:32:47.392 --> 00:32:48.795
Hey.

492
00:32:56.135 --> 00:32:57.870
How long was I asleep?

493
00:32:59.705 --> 00:33:01.073
I mean,

494
00:33:01.207 --> 00:33:03.676
we found you here, like,
six hours ago.

495
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.617
Did it get dark at all?

496
00:33:13.987 --> 00:33:16.857
For a couple of hours,
not completely.

497
00:33:18.592 --> 00:33:20.827
Is it tomorrow?

498
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.964
I mean,
from yesterday's perspective.

499
00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:29.669
Come on.

500
00:33:32.806 --> 00:33:34.474
Where are we going?

501
00:33:34.608 --> 00:33:35.843
What we came for.

502
00:34:15.017 --> 00:34:17.019
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

503
00:34:17.152 --> 00:34:19.621
Yeah, this is way
the hell out there.

504
00:34:23.524 --> 00:34:26.028
Do they have ticks
in Sweden?

505
00:34:26.161 --> 00:34:28.062
Sweden has a tick problem.

506
00:34:28.463 --> 00:34:29.464
What?

507
00:34:29.597 --> 00:34:30.797
No they don't, do they really?

508
00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:32.400
Actually,
it is a big problem.

509
00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:34.236
Last summer,
a record number of people

510
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.005
got tick-borne encephalitis.

511
00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:38.406
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

512
00:34:38.539 --> 00:34:40.575
Both my grandparents
died from ticks.

513
00:34:40.709 --> 00:34:42.309
Had to give them
a closed casket funeral.

514
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:46.282
Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

515
00:34:46.414 --> 00:34:47.850
And believe me,
if you ask him,

516
00:34:47.983 --> 00:34:50.185
it was not worth the pleasant
picnic in the park.

517
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.487
He's fucked.

518
00:35:34.831 --> 00:35:36.533
So, this is the place.

519
00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:39.602
The tranquil
and majestic Harga.

520
00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.308
Pelle, you know
all these people?

521
00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:46.077
These are my family!

522
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:52.081
So we're stopping in Waco

523
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.850
before going
to Pelle's village?

524
00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:09.000
Oh, thank you!

525
00:36:09.134 --> 00:36:11.236
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

526
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.304
- Oh, wow, thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

527
00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:14.739
This bag?

528
00:36:15.407 --> 00:36:17.042
Thank you... Uh, sorry.

529
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.145
Hey, guys?

530
00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:21.580
Meet my sister, Dagny.

531
00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:23.448
Born the exact same day as me.

532
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:26.650
- Hi.
- Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

533
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.922
- Uh, <i>tack!</i>
- Thank you.

534
00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:32.823
<i>- Tack.</i>
- Hey.

535
00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:45.971
Father Odd!

536
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.925
Sorry,
these are my friends.

537
00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:08.728
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

538
00:37:09.595 --> 00:37:10.629
- Hello.
- Hi.

539
00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:13.966
Welcome, welcome.

540
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.935
- Hi, oh!
- Welcome home.

541
00:37:16.803 --> 00:37:19.704
We are so very happy
to have you.

542
00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.140
Oh, thank you.

543
00:37:21.274 --> 00:37:24.677
Pelle has an immaculate sense
for people.

544
00:37:25.878 --> 00:37:27.481
I... I love
what you're wearing.

545
00:37:27.613 --> 00:37:28.658
- My frock?
- Uh-huh.

546
00:37:28.682 --> 00:37:30.049
Yeah, quite girly, no?

547
00:37:31.084 --> 00:37:33.786
We do these as a tribute
in respect of Ymir

548
00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:36.156
and because of the nature's

549
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:41.195
hermaphrodite,
I think, qualities. Yeah.

550
00:37:41.328 --> 00:37:44.398
Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing

551
00:37:44.532 --> 00:37:46.334
in Brajbhoomi?

552
00:37:46.468 --> 00:37:48.969
So, we are your hosts.

553
00:37:49.103 --> 00:37:50.703
So whatever you need,
just say so

554
00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:52.540
and we will accommodate, okay?

555
00:37:52.673 --> 00:37:54.007
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

556
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.709
Today is all festivities.

557
00:37:55.843 --> 00:37:58.611
Um, just tomorrow,
the official ceremony begin

558
00:37:58.745 --> 00:38:00.214
and you are welcome!

559
00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:02.616
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

560
00:38:02.749 --> 00:38:04.552
Yeah. Enjoy.

561
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:06.821
Just... Thank you.

562
00:38:08.423 --> 00:38:10.291
That guy
has a very red face.

563
00:38:10.824 --> 00:38:12.393
Yeah?

564
00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:17.265
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:39:22.532 --> 00:39:25.768
- Can I take photos?
- Um... Discreetly.

566
00:39:29.372 --> 00:39:30.440
Thanks.

567
00:39:31.274 --> 00:39:32.876
Oh, forgive me.

568
00:39:33.009 --> 00:39:35.878
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

569
00:39:36.745 --> 00:39:39.115
Welcome to Harga,

570
00:39:39.783 --> 00:39:41.218
and happy midsummer!

571
00:39:41.352 --> 00:39:45.121
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

572
00:39:45.255 --> 00:39:48.459
and it will be 90 years
before our next.

573
00:39:48.593 --> 00:39:51.195
And what poetry
that it's now the hottest

574
00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:53.964
and brightest summer
on record.

575
00:39:54.097 --> 00:39:57.067
We already have
so much to give back

576
00:39:57.201 --> 00:39:59.769
and so, without any
further blathering,

577
00:39:59.904 --> 00:40:02.106
let's raise our glasses.

578
00:40:04.675 --> 00:40:08.079
Let our
Nine-Day feast commence.

579
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.816
You guys should join.

580
00:41:48.948 --> 00:41:52.186
Oh, no, I'm too scared.

581
00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:00.927
- All right.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

582
00:42:03.832 --> 00:42:05.332
What are the kids playing?

583
00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:07.234
Skin the fool.

584
00:42:07.368 --> 00:42:09.937
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

585
00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:11.905
Precious.

586
00:42:25.387 --> 00:42:27.522
Hey, Pelle,
can anybody just join in?

587
00:42:27.655 --> 00:42:31.059
You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

588
00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:32.560
All right.

589
00:42:35.498 --> 00:42:36.598
Hey.

590
00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:39.434
Happy birthday.

591
00:42:42.203 --> 00:42:44.306
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

592
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.008
Just something I do
for birthdays.

593
00:42:47.142 --> 00:42:48.510
Maybe it's not appropriate?

594
00:42:48.643 --> 00:42:52.180
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

595
00:42:52.314 --> 00:42:54.483
It's beautiful.

596
00:42:54.617 --> 00:42:56.551
Anyway, just between us.

597
00:42:57.853 --> 00:42:59.588
Yeah, well...

598
00:42:59.722 --> 00:43:02.992
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

599
00:43:03.626 --> 00:43:04.993
Oh.

600
00:43:05.126 --> 00:43:07.329
No. No, no, no,
I forgot to remind him

601
00:43:07.463 --> 00:43:09.665
and it's not
his fault, it's...

602
00:43:10.933 --> 00:43:11.933
Never mind, it's okay.

603
00:43:12.034 --> 00:43:13.537
This is beautiful.

604
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.205
Thank you so much,
I'm really touched.

605
00:43:18.174 --> 00:43:20.409
So, how do you support
this place?

606
00:43:20.543 --> 00:43:22.978
Lumbering, linen,
homeopathics...

607
00:43:23.112 --> 00:43:24.480
Water power plant.

608
00:43:26.382 --> 00:43:28.083
School time over here.

609
00:43:29.051 --> 00:43:30.186
Carving runes?

610
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.521
Really?

611
00:43:33.056 --> 00:43:36.025
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

612
00:43:36.158 --> 00:43:38.628
Oh, yeah.
I do that, too.

613
00:43:38.762 --> 00:43:40.630
Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

614
00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:42.399
Oh, shit.

615
00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:44.333
What alphabet is that from?

616
00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:47.537
Uh, the Younger Futhark.

617
00:43:47.671 --> 00:43:49.406
I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

618
00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:52.142
Actually, that is
the Elder Futhark.

619
00:43:52.275 --> 00:43:55.010
So, how long have you two
been together?

620
00:43:55.145 --> 00:43:57.247
- Oh, geez, um...
- Um...

621
00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.282
Just over
three and a half years.

622
00:43:59.983 --> 00:44:01.218
Four years.

623
00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:03.820
- No? Really?
- Yeah.

624
00:44:03.955 --> 00:44:05.489
Four years in two weeks.

625
00:44:07.157 --> 00:44:08.359
You're right, I'm sorry.

626
00:44:08.493 --> 00:44:10.661
- You're right. Four years.
- Mmm-hmm.

627
00:44:12.696 --> 00:44:16.166
Yeah, um,
how did you guys all meet?

628
00:44:17.802 --> 00:44:19.003
Well, uh...

629
00:44:19.136 --> 00:44:21.105
We were all working
on the same farm

630
00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:24.040
and funny enough,
I was dating Connie

631
00:44:24.174 --> 00:44:26.410
when Simon and me
first became pals.

632
00:44:26.544 --> 00:44:28.714
Well, we'd been on a date.

633
00:44:28.847 --> 00:44:31.048
And I didn't even actually
know it was a date, so...

634
00:44:31.181 --> 00:44:32.550
You're right. No, no.

635
00:44:32.683 --> 00:44:34.194
I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

636
00:44:34.218 --> 00:44:36.053
We... We decided to be friends.

637
00:44:36.187 --> 00:44:37.523
And that was just before

638
00:44:37.656 --> 00:44:39.858
Connie and Simon
started dating.

639
00:44:39.992 --> 00:44:41.526
And now they're engaged.

640
00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:44.128
- What? Congratulations!
- Wow.

641
00:44:44.262 --> 00:44:46.130
Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

642
00:44:46.264 --> 00:44:49.101
Yeah, thanks. Yeah,
we actually asked Ingemar

643
00:44:49.234 --> 00:44:50.635
to officiate the wedding.

644
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:52.303
- Really?
- Nah.

645
00:44:52.436 --> 00:44:54.540
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

646
00:44:55.474 --> 00:44:57.276
It's like a sacred temple,

647
00:44:57.409 --> 00:44:59.444
but no one's allowed in there.

648
00:45:00.679 --> 00:45:03.080
Uh, let me show you
where we sleep.

649
00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:06.585
Let me show you
the <i>Rotvalta!</i>

650
00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:08.888
So we're just gonna ignore
the bear then?

651
00:45:09.521 --> 00:45:11.123
It's a bear.

652
00:45:16.161 --> 00:45:17.430
What's that?

653
00:45:18.498 --> 00:45:20.532
- We can check it out.
- Yeah.

654
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:31.243
Love story.

655
00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:12.620
Oh, wow. What? Wow.

656
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:17.558
Wow.

657
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:21.195
Wow, wow, wow.

658
00:46:22.897 --> 00:46:26.001
Oh, man. Wow.

659
00:46:26.133 --> 00:46:29.403
It's like in the Scripture.

660
00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:34.709
What do you think?

661
00:46:36.443 --> 00:46:37.879
It's like another world.

662
00:46:38.913 --> 00:46:40.482
Amazing.

663
00:46:40.615 --> 00:46:42.083
People just sleep here?

664
00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:43.294
Yeah, all the younger ones

665
00:46:43.318 --> 00:46:44.486
until we turn 36

666
00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:46.153
and then we move
to the laborers house.

667
00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:47.555
Why 36?

668
00:46:47.689 --> 00:46:49.858
Well, we think of life
like the seasons.

669
00:46:49.991 --> 00:46:52.727
So you're a child until
you're 18 and that's Spring.

670
00:46:52.862 --> 00:46:54.963
And then at some point,
we all do our Pilgrimage

671
00:46:55.096 --> 00:46:56.765
which is between 18 and 36.

672
00:46:56.898 --> 00:47:01.236
That's Summer,
and then from 36 to 54,

673
00:47:01.369 --> 00:47:03.739
we're working age,
which is Fall.

674
00:47:03.873 --> 00:47:07.509
And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

675
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:10.946
What happens at 72?

676
00:47:15.117 --> 00:47:16.584
Not a lot of privacy.

677
00:47:16.719 --> 00:47:18.697
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

678
00:47:18.721 --> 00:47:20.332
Especially with all these
dicks on the wall.

679
00:47:20.356 --> 00:47:21.356
There's a lot of dicks.

680
00:47:37.974 --> 00:47:39.254
Did she say something?

681
00:47:39.308 --> 00:47:40.644
No, no, no, absolutely not.

682
00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:43.245
I just wanted to
let you know before, so...

683
00:47:43.379 --> 00:47:44.914
Are these the May Queens?

684
00:47:45.681 --> 00:47:47.050
Yeah.

685
00:47:47.184 --> 00:47:50.053
Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

686
00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:53.056
And who are your May Queens?

687
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.892
Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

688
00:47:56.026 --> 00:47:57.694
and the winner gets crowned
and this is...

689
00:47:57.828 --> 00:48:00.497
- Oh, wow.
- Hey!

690
00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:11.975
Was that...

691
00:48:13.076 --> 00:48:14.544
You saw that too, right?

692
00:48:16.546 --> 00:48:17.882
Pelle, who was that?

693
00:48:18.015 --> 00:48:19.550
Inge.

694
00:48:19.684 --> 00:48:21.785
Oh, my God,
I want to give her a bath.

695
00:48:21.918 --> 00:48:24.755
Hey, can I pull you outside
for a sec?

696
00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:26.991
Yeah, sure.

697
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.695
Pelle,
tell her to come back.

698
00:48:40.872 --> 00:48:43.641
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

699
00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:44.876
What?

700
00:48:45.576 --> 00:48:49.514
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

701
00:48:49.648 --> 00:48:54.519
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dani ♪</i>

702
00:48:54.652 --> 00:48:58.056
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

703
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:59.458
Fuck.

704
00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:02.961
- Stop, it's fine.
- What?

705
00:49:04.029 --> 00:49:06.365
You didn't think
I forgot, did you?

706
00:49:08.867 --> 00:49:10.002
I'm sorry.

707
00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:11.737
I'm sorry I got fucked up
by the daylight

708
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.238
and I thought
it was yesterday.

709
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:14.716
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Happy birthday.

710
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.917
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. I'm not upset.

711
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.941
It's okay.

712
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.944
- You should be.
- I... I should be.

713
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.879
I'm sorry.

714
00:49:46.105 --> 00:49:48.007
All right, beauty rest.

715
00:49:49.108 --> 00:49:50.643
Tomorrow's a big day.

716
00:49:52.378 --> 00:49:53.780
What's tomorrow?

717
00:49:53.913 --> 00:49:55.648
First of the big ceremonies.

718
00:50:00.453 --> 00:50:02.122
<i>Attestupa.</i>

719
00:50:03.891 --> 00:50:05.059
What's that?

720
00:50:05.192 --> 00:50:06.660
Uh, it's too hard to explain,

721
00:50:06.793 --> 00:50:08.828
you'll get
a better sense tomorrow.

722
00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:12.465
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

723
00:50:14.668 --> 00:50:17.370
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

724
00:50:17.503 --> 00:50:19.706
I mean,
it's pretty actual.

725
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.908
Fuck.

726
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.478
Do you know what it is?

727
00:50:28.015 --> 00:50:29.049
Dude!

728
00:50:31.051 --> 00:50:32.720
Is it scary?

729
00:50:36.223 --> 00:50:37.958
That is so fucking annoying.

730
00:50:38.092 --> 00:50:40.027
Yo! Check my scalp for ticks,

731
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.229
then I'll check yours.

732
00:52:08.118 --> 00:52:09.363
Somebody should tell
those girls

733
00:52:09.387 --> 00:52:10.787
they're walking stupid.

734
00:52:18.161 --> 00:52:20.831
How long
do they typically stand?

735
00:52:20.965 --> 00:52:23.867
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

736
00:52:27.238 --> 00:52:29.606
Hey. Oh.

737
00:52:29.741 --> 00:52:31.742
- Are these for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

738
00:52:32.542 --> 00:52:34.544
- You pick 'em backwards?
- Yeah.

739
00:53:38.609 --> 00:53:40.279
Are those the ones?

740
00:53:40.412 --> 00:53:41.747
Yeah.

741
00:54:07.806 --> 00:54:09.042
Dude, I'm so hungry.

742
00:54:09.175 --> 00:54:11.311
It's like they're trying
to make it gross.

743
00:54:25.459 --> 00:54:27.894
Her... Her mother
is on Pilgrimage.

744
00:54:28.027 --> 00:54:30.097
- Oh...
- Helps her to detach.

745
00:54:30.697 --> 00:54:31.932
Okay.

746
00:54:32.066 --> 00:54:33.834
The babies
are raised here by everyone.

747
00:54:34.503 --> 00:54:36.636
Wow. You want this?

748
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.726
Dude, are you
following them out?

749
00:57:07.859 --> 00:57:09.360
I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

750
00:57:09.494 --> 00:57:12.030
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

751
00:57:12.163 --> 00:57:14.999
Wait,
what're we doing now?

752
00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:15.523
What is that book?

753
00:59:15.657 --> 00:59:18.225
<i>Rubi Radr.</i>
Our scripture.

754
00:59:20.862 --> 00:59:22.899
Can I read that?

755
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.466
You would not be able.

756
01:01:49.882 --> 01:01:51.784
Oh, my God!

757
01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.255
It's fine.

758
01:01:56.388 --> 01:01:57.890
Did she jump?

759
01:01:58.023 --> 01:01:59.123
What the...

760
01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.535
It's part of the ceremony.

761
01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:01.736
What?
No, she fell, she fell.

762
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.963
Fuck!

763
01:02:03.095 --> 01:02:05.130
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

764
01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:06.498
It's okay.

765
01:02:06.632 --> 01:02:08.434
Oh, my...
Did she fall or did she jump?

766
01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:10.937
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

767
01:02:11.071 --> 01:02:12.304
What do you mean it's fine?

768
01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:14.206
She's fucking dead.
Look at her head!

769
01:02:14.341 --> 01:02:15.975
Look at her head, she's dead!

770
01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.610
It's a part
of the ceremony.

771
01:02:17.743 --> 01:02:19.154
Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

772
01:02:19.178 --> 01:02:21.381
She just fucking jumped
off the cliff.

773
01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:25.118
Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

774
01:02:28.722 --> 01:02:30.223
Oh, my God.

775
01:02:31.257 --> 01:02:32.659
What the fuck?

776
01:02:43.604 --> 01:02:46.373
No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

777
01:02:47.207 --> 01:02:48.608
He's doing the same
fucking thing!

778
01:02:50.511 --> 01:02:53.014
Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

779
01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:54.581
Tell him to stop.

780
01:02:54.714 --> 01:02:57.084
Why's everyone just
standing there, what the fuck?

781
01:02:57.217 --> 01:03:00.254
Sir, don't...
Don't jump, don't jump!

782
01:03:00.388 --> 01:03:01.922
Please, someone tell him
not to jump.

783
01:03:02.057 --> 01:03:03.537
- What the fuck?
- Someone tell him...

784
01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.250
- He's still alive.
- What's going on?

785
01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.386
Fuck, we're going.

786
01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:40.323
- Fuck! This is fucked!
- Where?

787
01:04:40.456 --> 01:04:42.759
Fuck this! You're fucked!

788
01:04:42.893 --> 01:04:44.871
Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

789
01:04:44.895 --> 01:04:46.329
what the fuck is wrong
with you?

790
01:04:48.065 --> 01:04:51.201
- Please! Please!
- No, fucking leave her alone!

791
01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:53.036
Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

792
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.404
What? Explain what?

793
01:04:54.538 --> 01:04:56.473
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

794
01:04:56.607 --> 01:04:58.475
Please! What you just saw

795
01:04:58.609 --> 01:05:01.578
is a long, long,
long observed custom.

796
01:05:01.712 --> 01:05:03.380
- "Custom!" It's fucked!
- Yes.

797
01:05:03.514 --> 01:05:05.850
Those two who jumped
have just reached

798
01:05:05.984 --> 01:05:08.585
the end of
their Harga life-cycle.

799
01:05:08.719 --> 01:05:12.356
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

800
01:05:12.489 --> 01:05:15.093
- "Joy?"
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

801
01:05:15.226 --> 01:05:17.462
it will be a great joy for me.

802
01:05:17.595 --> 01:05:20.064
- Fuck.
- We view life as a circle,

803
01:05:20.198 --> 01:05:21.698
a recycle.

804
01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:25.003
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

805
01:05:25.136 --> 01:05:28.206
And that baby over there
who is not yet born

806
01:05:28.338 --> 01:05:30.307
will inherit that name.

807
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.776
Instead of getting old

808
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:35.181
and dying in pain
and fear and shame,

809
01:05:35.313 --> 01:05:37.481
we give our life.

810
01:05:38.049 --> 01:05:39.417
As a gesture.

811
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:41.986
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

812
01:05:42.554 --> 01:05:44.389
It does no good dying,

813
01:05:44.522 --> 01:05:46.891
lashing back
at the inevitable.

814
01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:49.494
It corrupts the spirit.

815
01:05:49.627 --> 01:05:52.898
I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

816
01:05:57.635 --> 01:05:58.971
You feeling okay?

817
01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.908
I just really need to not be
here right now.

818
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.043
Yeah.

819
01:06:09.447 --> 01:06:10.850
I'm gonna go.

820
01:06:10.983 --> 01:06:12.903
Just take some time
to yourself, okay.

821
01:06:51.458 --> 01:06:53.060
- Hey, dude...
- Hey!

822
01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:55.695
Holy shit, right?

823
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:57.998
Are you okay?

824
01:06:58.632 --> 01:07:00.001
Yeah, I'm fine.

825
01:07:00.567 --> 01:07:01.836
Good.

826
01:07:07.507 --> 01:07:09.176
Hey, listen. Um...

827
01:07:10.077 --> 01:07:11.479
I've been thinking
about something

828
01:07:11.612 --> 01:07:13.046
that I wanted to ask you.

829
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.482
Or tell you, actually.

830
01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:17.852
Um...

831
01:07:20.922 --> 01:07:24.191
I've been thinking
a lot about my thesis.

832
01:07:24.325 --> 01:07:26.160
And, um...

833
01:07:26.294 --> 01:07:29.630
I've decided I'm gonna
do it here. On Harga.

834
01:07:30.933 --> 01:07:32.366
And I wanted to
tell you first.

835
01:07:32.499 --> 01:07:36.070
Just so it didn't seem like
I wasn't telling you.

836
01:07:38.874 --> 01:07:41.876
I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

837
01:07:46.514 --> 01:07:47.950
I mean... I mean, you know

838
01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:50.552
I'm doing my thesis on
midsummer. That's the reason

839
01:07:50.686 --> 01:07:52.054
- why I'm here.
- Yeah.

840
01:07:53.855 --> 01:07:56.224
Yeah, but not
on this community.

841
01:07:56.358 --> 01:07:59.195
I mean, you're going
to Germany and England next.

842
01:08:00.862 --> 01:08:03.565
Well, you knew I was
gonna wanna do this.

843
01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:07.437
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

844
01:08:07.569 --> 01:08:09.372
I mean, did you even know
until just now?

845
01:08:09.504 --> 01:08:10.664
Christian, of course you did!

846
01:08:10.739 --> 01:08:12.174
Okay, do you think
I don't know

847
01:08:12.307 --> 01:08:13.976
what you're doing?

848
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:16.611
It's actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle.

849
01:08:16.745 --> 01:08:19.182
The fact that you're being
this bald about it.

850
01:08:19.315 --> 01:08:22.617
I'm... I'm honestly
kind of impressed.

851
01:08:22.751 --> 01:08:24.129
What the fuck, man?
What does that mean?

852
01:08:24.153 --> 01:08:25.487
Yeah, what the fuck!
This is what

853
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.924
I've been working toward
and you know it.

854
01:08:28.057 --> 01:08:30.135
That's why you look so guilty
right now, because you know.

855
01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:31.560
You know
that what you're doing

856
01:08:31.693 --> 01:08:33.796
is unethical and leechy
and lazy.

857
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.666
And, frankly,
it's kind of sad.

858
01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:39.203
- Fuck you!
- No, dude, not fuck me!

859
01:08:39.335 --> 01:08:40.837
Find your own subject.

860
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:42.372
Or... Or your own passion.

861
01:08:42.505 --> 01:08:44.073
And, because...
All right, look.

862
01:08:44.208 --> 01:08:46.576
I am... I'm actually
invested in this.

863
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:47.978
This is not some
glorified hobby

864
01:08:48.112 --> 01:08:50.513
that I'm casually
dipping my feet into.

865
01:08:58.022 --> 01:08:59.956
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

866
01:09:00.823 --> 01:09:02.259
If you're gonna
do it here too,

867
01:09:02.393 --> 01:09:04.795
I'm open to collaborating.

868
01:09:04.928 --> 01:09:07.365
And if not, I guess we can
both do separate theses

869
01:09:07.499 --> 01:09:08.698
on the Hargas.

870
01:09:15.906 --> 01:09:18.208
Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

871
01:09:18.509 --> 01:09:19.777
What?

872
01:09:24.382 --> 01:09:25.793
We're leaving
tomorrow morning.

873
01:09:25.817 --> 01:09:26.818
I know we are.

874
01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:28.520
I told Christian this already,

875
01:09:28.652 --> 01:09:30.331
and now I think he's trying
to pretend like it's his idea,

876
01:09:30.355 --> 01:09:32.166
- so if he comes up to you...
- Well, no,

877
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:33.892
wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt that

878
01:09:34.025 --> 01:09:35.870
the elders will approve of
anything being written down.

879
01:09:35.894 --> 01:09:37.295
They're extremely protective.

880
01:09:37.429 --> 01:09:39.040
Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

881
01:09:39.064 --> 01:09:40.707
- Problem solved.
- Then what would be the point?

882
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:42.209
You couldn't even get it
peer reviewed.

883
01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:44.302
And Christian did already
ask me this, by the way,

884
01:09:44.437 --> 01:09:47.272
and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

885
01:09:47.405 --> 01:09:49.674
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

886
01:09:49.808 --> 01:09:51.009
Ah, fuck. No.

887
01:09:51.142 --> 01:09:53.312
Okay, look, uh,
I'll ask the elders.

888
01:09:53.446 --> 01:09:55.247
- Okay? Good.
- Yep.

889
01:10:06.492 --> 01:10:07.759
Dani?

890
01:10:09.428 --> 01:10:11.263
Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

891
01:10:11.397 --> 01:10:13.375
Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

892
01:10:13.399 --> 01:10:15.000
Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

893
01:10:15.134 --> 01:10:16.777
I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

894
01:10:16.801 --> 01:10:19.805
I mean, I know it looks
extreme. But we only...

895
01:10:19.939 --> 01:10:21.841
I don't know
why I'm here, Pelle!

896
01:10:21.974 --> 01:10:23.214
I don't know
why you invited us.

897
01:10:23.276 --> 01:10:24.843
I don't know.
I don't know why...

898
01:10:24.976 --> 01:10:26.555
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

899
01:10:26.579 --> 01:10:28.156
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know and I can't...

900
01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.940
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

901
01:10:30.015 --> 01:10:31.260
Dani, please.

902
01:10:31.284 --> 01:10:32.818
Please sit down.

903
01:10:33.819 --> 01:10:35.087
Dani.

904
01:10:37.389 --> 01:10:38.657
I invited my friends

905
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:40.069
because this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

906
01:10:40.093 --> 01:10:41.660
and I wanted to share it.

907
01:10:41.794 --> 01:10:45.131
Especially with my friends who
I knew would appreciate it.

908
01:10:45.264 --> 01:10:46.264
Because I...

909
01:10:46.366 --> 01:10:47.867
- I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

910
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.603
Okay, but I'm not
an anthropologist

911
01:10:49.735 --> 01:10:51.047
and I don't understand
any of this.

912
01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:52.449
- Yes, yes, yes. I know.
- I don't get it.

913
01:10:52.473 --> 01:10:53.639
I know. And, and yet,

914
01:10:53.772 --> 01:10:56.042
I was the most excited
for you to come.

915
01:10:56.176 --> 01:11:00.080
Here. Here, smell this.

916
01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:03.016
What is it?

917
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:04.918
- It calms you down.
- No, I'm fine.

918
01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:07.120
I don't want it.

919
01:11:08.523 --> 01:11:10.056
- Are you sure?
- No...

920
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:12.035
I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

921
01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:14.427
Okay.

922
01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.763
I know what
you're going through, Dani.

923
01:11:18.499 --> 01:11:20.134
What am I going through?

924
01:11:20.268 --> 01:11:21.802
Because I lost
my parents, too.

925
01:11:21.936 --> 01:11:23.770
- What? No, no, Pelle.
- Yes, yes, yes...

926
01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:25.249
That is not what
I'm talking about.

927
01:11:25.273 --> 01:11:26.806
I'm not talking
about my family.

928
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:28.152
I know that's not what
you're talking about.

929
01:11:28.176 --> 01:11:29.496
I'm not talking
about my family...

930
01:11:29.544 --> 01:11:30.754
I lost my parents
when I was a little boy.

931
01:11:30.778 --> 01:11:32.078
They burned up in a fire.

932
01:11:32.212 --> 01:11:33.656
No, I wasn't talking
about that.

933
01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.751
My parents,
they burned up in a fire

934
01:11:36.884 --> 01:11:39.053
and I became,
technically, an orphan.

935
01:11:39.187 --> 01:11:41.956
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

936
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:45.193
Because I do,
I really, really do.

937
01:11:47.228 --> 01:11:50.765
Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

938
01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:54.802
because I had a family here.

939
01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:59.241
Where everyone embraced me.
And swept me up.

940
01:12:00.509 --> 01:12:02.544
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't

941
01:12:02.678 --> 01:12:06.381
bicker over what's theirs
and what's not theirs.

942
01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.917
That's what you were given.

943
01:12:09.652 --> 01:12:12.454
But I have always felt held.

944
01:12:16.559 --> 01:12:19.927
By a family. A real family.

945
01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:26.835
Which everyone deserves.

946
01:12:28.705 --> 01:12:30.239
And you deserve.

947
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.649
Pelle, Christian
could walk in.

948
01:12:38.781 --> 01:12:40.782
He's what I'm talking about.

949
01:12:43.453 --> 01:12:45.955
He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

950
01:12:47.123 --> 01:12:49.758
Dani, do you feel held by him?

951
01:12:52.328 --> 01:12:54.465
Does he feel like home to you?

952
01:13:35.607 --> 01:13:37.941
Hey. How you doing?

953
01:13:38.909 --> 01:13:40.911
Today was tough.

954
01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:45.383
You gonna be okay?

955
01:13:48.018 --> 01:13:50.388
Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

956
01:13:50.954 --> 01:13:53.825
Yeah, of course I am.

957
01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:56.594
That was really,
really shocking.

958
01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:00.298
I'm trying to keep
an open mind though.

959
01:14:01.599 --> 01:14:03.502
That's cultural, you know?

960
01:14:03.636 --> 01:14:05.936
We stick our elders
in nursing homes.

961
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:08.273
I'm sure they find
that disturbing.

962
01:14:09.675 --> 01:14:13.346
I think we really need to just
at least try to acclimate.

963
01:14:22.288 --> 01:14:23.622
Hey, do you... Sorry.

964
01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:26.459
Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

965
01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:27.592
Yeah, sure.

966
01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.860
Thanks.

967
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:57.624
You're gonna wake her.

968
01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:00.478
Yo, Pelle.

969
01:18:15.794 --> 01:18:17.094
What'cha doin'?

970
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:20.265
Just working in the garden.

971
01:18:26.004 --> 01:18:27.539
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

972
01:18:27.974 --> 01:18:29.240
Any word?

973
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:31.644
Yeah, they said you can do it.

974
01:18:31.777 --> 01:18:34.245
As long as you absolutely
don't use any names.

975
01:18:34.379 --> 01:18:35.523
- Okay. Wow.
- Or the location

976
01:18:35.547 --> 01:18:36.581
is never even hinted at.

977
01:18:36.716 --> 01:18:38.149
- Okay.
- And you'll have to sign

978
01:18:38.283 --> 01:18:39.652
an agreement to that.

979
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.822
And you're splitting it
with Christian

980
01:18:42.956 --> 01:18:45.523
because he came to me first.

981
01:18:45.658 --> 01:18:48.060
Well, that's... We'll...
We'll figure that out.

982
01:18:48.194 --> 01:18:49.295
I gotta go take a leak.

983
01:18:49.428 --> 01:18:51.999
Uh, here, can I
ask you something?

984
01:18:52.131 --> 01:18:53.164
- Yeah.
- Uh...

985
01:18:53.298 --> 01:18:56.335
Do you know what this is?

986
01:18:57.336 --> 01:18:59.873
I found it
under Christian's bed.

987
01:19:00.007 --> 01:19:04.610
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

988
01:19:04.744 --> 01:19:07.513
- A love rune. Huh.
- Yeah.

989
01:19:07.648 --> 01:19:09.716
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

990
01:19:12.284 --> 01:19:14.320
What's going on?

991
01:19:14.453 --> 01:19:16.198
Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

992
01:19:16.222 --> 01:19:19.359
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

993
01:19:19.993 --> 01:19:21.029
Are you serious?

994
01:19:21.161 --> 01:19:22.528
Yeah.

995
01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:25.365
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

996
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.534
That is incredible news.
Thank you.

997
01:19:27.668 --> 01:19:29.148
You're splitting it
with Josh as well.

998
01:19:29.269 --> 01:19:32.072
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

999
01:19:32.204 --> 01:19:33.940
Okay. Well, I think my sister

1000
01:19:34.074 --> 01:19:35.943
Maja has taken
a liking to you.

1001
01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:38.713
Yeah?

1002
01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:41.048
The red head?

1003
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.919
Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig</i> last year.

1004
01:19:46.253 --> 01:19:48.856
It basically means that,
uh, you are...

1005
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:52.794
You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

1006
01:19:52.927 --> 01:19:54.394
- Okay. Good for her.
- Hey!

1007
01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:02.470
Hey, whoa!

1008
01:20:04.105 --> 01:20:05.940
What? Okay, relax. Relax!

1009
01:20:06.075 --> 01:20:07.608
What did I do?

1010
01:20:07.742 --> 01:20:10.545
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened? What happened?

1011
01:20:14.348 --> 01:20:15.717
What did I do? What did I do?

1012
01:20:18.219 --> 01:20:19.587
Dude! Okay!

1013
01:20:20.455 --> 01:20:22.290
You pissed
on the ancestral tree.

1014
01:20:22.423 --> 01:20:24.026
- The tree... So what?
- Yes, yes.

1015
01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:25.293
"So what?"

1016
01:20:26.562 --> 01:20:27.830
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

1017
01:20:27.963 --> 01:20:29.464
That tree is tied
to all of our dead.

1018
01:20:29.597 --> 01:20:31.867
It's a dead tree, though.

1019
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.535
- It's dead.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1020
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:35.070
But it's important to us.

1021
01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.372
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

1022
01:20:54.356 --> 01:20:55.625
Hey.

1023
01:20:55.759 --> 01:20:57.594
Hey. It was
really nice to meet you.

1024
01:20:57.726 --> 01:21:00.329
I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

1025
01:21:00.462 --> 01:21:01.663
What?

1026
01:21:01.798 --> 01:21:03.500
- Yeah.
- Connie.

1027
01:21:03.633 --> 01:21:05.678
Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

1028
01:21:05.702 --> 01:21:07.904
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

1029
01:21:09.172 --> 01:21:10.539
Connie.

1030
01:21:11.306 --> 01:21:12.842
Oh, there.

1031
01:21:12.976 --> 01:21:15.745
Uh, Simon,
he told me to tell you

1032
01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.380
that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

1033
01:21:18.515 --> 01:21:20.917
And after, uh,
Simon gets dropped off,

1034
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:23.686
he's sending the truck
back for you.

1035
01:21:23.821 --> 01:21:24.621
What?

1036
01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:27.857
You will meet him, uh, there.

1037
01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:29.459
No.

1038
01:21:29.592 --> 01:21:31.327
Why would he
just go without me?

1039
01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:32.730
He... He wouldn't do that.

1040
01:21:32.863 --> 01:21:35.833
Well, the truck
only had room for two.

1041
01:21:35.966 --> 01:21:37.268
So...

1042
01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.204
What does that mean?

1043
01:21:40.336 --> 01:21:41.380
That doesn't even
make any sense.

1044
01:21:41.404 --> 01:21:42.773
He would have told me.

1045
01:21:42.907 --> 01:21:45.110
Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

1046
01:21:45.243 --> 01:21:47.711
It takes about 35 minutes
to go there and back.

1047
01:21:47.845 --> 01:21:49.914
So they didn't
want to waste time.

1048
01:21:50.047 --> 01:21:52.284
So I could have
sat on his lap.

1049
01:21:52.416 --> 01:21:53.818
Yes, I imagined that, too,

1050
01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:57.288
but, you know, we...
We don't break traffic laws.

1051
01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.689
Okay?

1052
01:22:01.193 --> 01:22:03.061
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

1053
01:22:03.195 --> 01:22:05.930
Now, Connie. There was
no room in the truck.

1054
01:22:06.063 --> 01:22:09.301
Yet, it is coming right back
for you. Yeah.

1055
01:22:13.138 --> 01:22:14.505
This is bullshit.

1056
01:22:24.316 --> 01:22:26.383
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1057
01:22:34.292 --> 01:22:37.796
And how are jobs
or roles assigned?

1058
01:22:37.929 --> 01:22:40.766
That's based on traits
we show as kids.

1059
01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.169
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. Sorry.

1060
01:22:43.301 --> 01:22:44.669
Um...

1061
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:47.372
Simon left without Connie.

1062
01:22:48.207 --> 01:22:50.109
- Jesus, really?
- Yeah.

1063
01:22:50.243 --> 01:22:51.711
What a dick move.

1064
01:22:52.645 --> 01:22:54.579
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

1065
01:22:54.713 --> 01:22:56.091
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

1066
01:22:56.115 --> 01:22:57.382
No, no.

1067
01:22:58.351 --> 01:22:59.852
That sucks.

1068
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:05.490
On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

1069
01:23:06.626 --> 01:23:09.495
Is there ever an issue here
with incest?

1070
01:23:11.198 --> 01:23:14.800
Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

1071
01:23:14.934 --> 01:23:17.503
Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

1072
01:23:17.637 --> 01:23:21.208
So, uh, the elders
must approve mates.

1073
01:23:21.341 --> 01:23:23.709
Cousins can sometimes mate.

1074
01:23:23.843 --> 01:23:26.947
But we do respect
their incest taboo.

1075
01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.751
So we often need to invite
outside people.

1076
01:23:52.039 --> 01:23:54.574
Excuse me. Hey.

1077
01:23:55.542 --> 01:23:57.544
Would you like
to help join us?

1078
01:23:59.347 --> 01:24:00.614
Uh...

1079
01:24:01.448 --> 01:24:03.952
- Sure, yeah.
- Come.

1080
01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:06.921
Do you...
Do you know, um...

1081
01:24:07.055 --> 01:24:09.123
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1082
01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:11.625
Yes. He was
driven to the station.

1083
01:24:11.758 --> 01:24:13.328
Did you not say goodbye?

1084
01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.796
No. No, I didn't.

1085
01:24:14.929 --> 01:24:17.498
But, uh, that's okay,
that's okay.

1086
01:24:17.632 --> 01:24:19.700
Hi.

1087
01:24:24.605 --> 01:24:26.175
What are we making here?

1088
01:24:26.308 --> 01:24:27.675
Meat tarts!

1089
01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:29.777
Oh, wow.

1090
01:24:29.911 --> 01:24:31.713
Oh, thank you.

1091
01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:35.818
She said you're so beautiful.

1092
01:24:36.551 --> 01:24:38.387
Oh, thank you.

1093
01:24:38.519 --> 01:24:41.056
Um, she's so beautiful.

1094
01:24:44.693 --> 01:24:48.163
We describe it
like emotional sheet music.

1095
01:24:48.297 --> 01:24:49.797
Hmm. What does it say?

1096
01:24:49.932 --> 01:24:52.500
Well, each runic letter

1097
01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:55.338
stands for one
of the 16 affects,

1098
01:24:55.472 --> 01:24:59.507
which are graded from
most holy to most unholy.

1099
01:24:59.641 --> 01:25:01.977
This one, for example,
is about grief.

1100
01:25:02.111 --> 01:25:03.111
Hmm.

1101
01:25:03.179 --> 01:25:05.215
You can see
at the end, however,

1102
01:25:05.348 --> 01:25:08.050
we have blank pages.

1103
01:25:08.183 --> 01:25:13.056
This is because the <i>Rubi Radr</i>
is a work forever in progress.

1104
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:14.189
Forever evolving.

1105
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:17.293
We have many,
many hundreds of these.

1106
01:25:18.627 --> 01:25:22.365
And who decides
what gets added?

1107
01:25:22.499 --> 01:25:27.237
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

1108
01:25:29.973 --> 01:25:33.344
Uh, the disabled?

1109
01:25:33.477 --> 01:25:35.513
Since birth.

1110
01:25:35.645 --> 01:25:39.649
He draws
and we, the elders, interpret.

1111
01:25:41.117 --> 01:25:42.153
You see, Josh,

1112
01:25:42.286 --> 01:25:45.554
Rubin is unclouded
by normal cognition.

1113
01:25:45.688 --> 01:25:48.958
It makes him open
for the source.

1114
01:25:49.092 --> 01:25:55.565
Uh, what happens
when Rubin dies?

1115
01:25:55.698 --> 01:25:58.701
Do you just wait
for a baby that is...

1116
01:26:00.638 --> 01:26:01.672
Not clouded?

1117
01:26:01.806 --> 01:26:03.040
No, no, no.

1118
01:26:03.174 --> 01:26:06.343
Uh, Rubin was a product
of inbreeding.

1119
01:26:07.278 --> 01:26:08.278
All of our Oracles

1120
01:26:08.312 --> 01:26:11.249
are deliberate products
of inbreeding.

1121
01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:16.087
Can I take a photograph?

1122
01:26:17.588 --> 01:26:19.156
What?

1123
01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:20.559
Uh, a photograph?

1124
01:26:20.691 --> 01:26:24.095
- No. Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

1125
01:26:24.228 --> 01:26:26.897
Absolutely not.

1126
01:26:51.690 --> 01:26:53.692
Oh, fuck, yep, that's her.

1127
01:27:01.234 --> 01:27:02.300
Hey.

1128
01:27:09.775 --> 01:27:11.810
Oh, great. She's walking away.

1129
01:27:32.398 --> 01:27:33.666
Thank you.

1130
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.342
Thanks.

1131
01:27:43.075 --> 01:27:44.311
Thanks.

1132
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.119
Has anyone seen Connie?

1133
01:27:54.154 --> 01:27:55.889
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1134
01:27:56.823 --> 01:27:58.025
I'm sure I saw her trying out

1135
01:27:58.158 --> 01:27:59.692
for the sprinting
Olympics earlier.

1136
01:27:59.825 --> 01:28:00.994
What? Where?

1137
01:28:01.128 --> 01:28:02.930
Sorry, but I can say
what happened.

1138
01:28:03.063 --> 01:28:04.364
Her boyfriend
called the landline

1139
01:28:04.499 --> 01:28:06.700
from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

1140
01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:09.702
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

1141
01:28:13.073 --> 01:28:14.908
Okay, well, that's a relief.

1142
01:28:15.043 --> 01:28:17.078
Why would Simon leave
without her?

1143
01:28:18.279 --> 01:28:20.415
I'm sure it was just
a miscommunication.

1144
01:28:37.732 --> 01:28:39.934
I could see you
possibly doing that.

1145
01:28:44.973 --> 01:28:46.442
What the hell does that mean?

1146
01:28:52.715 --> 01:28:53.983
Never mind.

1147
01:29:00.656 --> 01:29:03.892
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

1148
01:29:09.665 --> 01:29:11.467
Dude, is he going to kill me?

1149
01:29:14.337 --> 01:29:16.904
Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

1150
01:29:22.978 --> 01:29:24.514
Oh, so now
you wanna collaborate?

1151
01:29:24.648 --> 01:29:25.882
Okay, thank you.

1152
01:29:26.015 --> 01:29:27.125
- I know that one elder...
- Thank you.

1153
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:28.284
...gave you a glimpse of it.

1154
01:29:28.418 --> 01:29:30.019
Thank you.
Sorry I brought it up.

1155
01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:56.946
Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

1156
01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.716
- Is that...
- What is that?

1157
01:29:58.848 --> 01:30:00.685
- Is that a fucking pube?
- Ew.

1158
01:30:00.817 --> 01:30:01.818
It's just a hair.

1159
01:30:01.951 --> 01:30:03.554
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1160
01:30:03.954 --> 01:30:05.690
Dude, calm down.

1161
01:30:05.822 --> 01:30:07.090
Why are you embarrassed?

1162
01:30:07.223 --> 01:30:09.959
You're not the one
giving out hair pies.

1163
01:30:29.448 --> 01:30:32.250
Jesus Christ. He's still
fucking lookin' at me.

1164
01:30:32.384 --> 01:30:35.052
Hey. You'll come with me?

1165
01:30:36.187 --> 01:30:38.022
- What?
- You'll come?

1166
01:30:38.657 --> 01:30:40.158
- Uh...
- I'll show you.

1167
01:30:40.559 --> 01:30:41.860
Okay, sure.

1168
01:30:41.993 --> 01:30:44.328
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

1169
01:30:44.462 --> 01:30:46.197
Um...

1170
01:30:46.331 --> 01:30:48.533
I'll be back. I guess
she's gonna show me.

1171
01:31:11.623 --> 01:31:13.860
Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

1172
01:31:13.992 --> 01:31:15.595
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

1173
01:31:18.531 --> 01:31:19.532
Thank you.

1174
01:33:08.309 --> 01:33:10.713
What the fuck, Mark?

1175
01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:12.491
What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door,

1176
01:33:12.515 --> 01:33:14.517
we're not supposed
to be in here.

1177
01:34:11.576 --> 01:34:13.710
Do you think Mark's
still up with that girl?

1178
01:34:14.878 --> 01:34:16.413
I wouldn't be surprised.

1179
01:34:19.417 --> 01:34:20.618
What about Josh though?

1180
01:34:20.751 --> 01:34:22.820
I'm honestly
not too concerned.

1181
01:34:24.588 --> 01:34:25.656
Wow.

1182
01:34:26.557 --> 01:34:28.559
We, um,

1183
01:34:28.693 --> 01:34:31.897
have something regretful
to announce.

1184
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:35.666
This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

1185
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.269
was found missing
from the Temple.

1186
01:34:39.637 --> 01:34:42.473
We don't want
to point fingers,

1187
01:34:42.607 --> 01:34:44.675
yet, we kindly ask
that whoever took it

1188
01:34:44.809 --> 01:34:47.012
to return it
to its original place.

1189
01:34:47.144 --> 01:34:48.680
You can leave it
in the Temple,

1190
01:34:48.814 --> 01:34:51.650
<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

1191
01:34:51.783 --> 01:34:54.786
<i>Nobody needs to know
it was you.</i>

1192
01:35:07.666 --> 01:35:09.134
Where is your friend, Josh?

1193
01:35:09.267 --> 01:35:12.504
I know. Uh, we have no idea.

1194
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:15.407
He and your other friend,

1195
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:18.276
they both disappears
the same day.

1196
01:35:19.879 --> 01:35:21.480
- You see how it looks?
- Yes, obviously.

1197
01:35:21.613 --> 01:35:23.615
But I swear to you
we're in the dark on this.

1198
01:35:23.749 --> 01:35:25.752
We're just as confused
as you are.

1199
01:35:27.086 --> 01:35:29.622
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

1200
01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:32.424
- What girl?
- Inge.

1201
01:35:32.557 --> 01:35:34.192
Yeah, but Mark
wouldn't have done this.

1202
01:35:34.326 --> 01:35:36.062
Josh on the other hand,

1203
01:35:36.194 --> 01:35:37.330
he came to bed with us

1204
01:35:37.463 --> 01:35:38.999
and when we woke up,
he was gone.

1205
01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:41.333
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

1206
01:35:41.466 --> 01:35:43.603
we don't associate
as friends of his

1207
01:35:43.736 --> 01:35:45.672
or collaborators or anything.

1208
01:35:45.805 --> 01:35:47.440
We would just be
so embarrassed

1209
01:35:47.573 --> 01:35:50.242
to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

1210
01:35:51.978 --> 01:35:54.614
Let's hope it gets returned.

1211
01:35:55.248 --> 01:35:56.249
I hope so too.

1212
01:35:56.382 --> 01:35:58.284
I feel responsible.

1213
01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:01.254
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1214
01:36:01.387 --> 01:36:03.757
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1215
01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:08.861
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1216
01:36:08.995 --> 01:36:10.329
Oh, hi.

1217
01:36:10.463 --> 01:36:13.467
And, uh, Siv wants to see you
in her house.

1218
01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.943
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:24.678
Okay.

1220
01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:27.414
Okay.

1221
01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:09.791
This is the big one.

1222
01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:12.627
Okay. Thank you.

1223
01:37:16.498 --> 01:37:17.966
Look into her eyes.

1224
01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.567
Mmm-hmm.

1225
01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:23.271
Um, can I ask
what this is exactly?

1226
01:37:23.405 --> 01:37:26.674
It's, um...
Tea for the competition.

1227
01:37:32.715 --> 01:37:36.384
- And then you, glass here.
- Mmm-hmm.

1228
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.121
And then we drink it.

1229
01:37:39.555 --> 01:37:40.956
- Okay?
- Okay.

1230
01:37:42.092 --> 01:37:43.292
Okay.

1231
01:37:47.596 --> 01:37:48.664
Mmm-hmm?

1232
01:37:50.133 --> 01:37:51.333
Uh-oh!

1233
01:37:51.467 --> 01:37:53.537
- Oh, God.
- Here we go!

1234
01:39:56.095 --> 01:39:57.530
Please. Come in.

1235
01:40:50.784 --> 01:40:51.984
First thing
I just have to say,

1236
01:40:52.087 --> 01:40:54.521
I have no idea where Josh is.

1237
01:40:54.656 --> 01:40:56.724
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1238
01:40:56.857 --> 01:40:58.859
How do you feel about Maja?

1239
01:41:03.531 --> 01:41:05.033
About Maja?

1240
01:41:10.205 --> 01:41:12.974
How do I
feel about her how?

1241
01:41:13.108 --> 01:41:16.044
You have been approved
to mate with her.

1242
01:41:16.177 --> 01:41:19.981
You're an ideal
astrological match.

1243
01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:22.851
And she has
fixed her hopes on you.

1244
01:41:29.225 --> 01:41:32.361
I think I ate
one of her pubic hairs.

1245
01:41:32.495 --> 01:41:34.263
Sounds probably right.

1246
01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:17.541
Stop!

1247
01:42:23.946 --> 01:42:25.916
Stay here.

1248
01:42:26.049 --> 01:42:27.760
Are you ready?

1249
01:42:27.784 --> 01:42:29.619
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1250
01:43:40.058 --> 01:43:42.127
Stop!

1251
01:43:46.131 --> 01:43:47.543
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1252
01:43:47.567 --> 01:43:48.577
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1253
01:43:48.601 --> 01:43:49.700
Eight! Eight!

1254
01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:51.035
- There are eight left.
- What?

1255
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.963
Uh...

1256
01:44:17.096 --> 01:44:19.165
- For you.
- Uh...

1257
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.235
Thanks.

1258
01:44:22.936 --> 01:44:24.704
- What is it?
- Um...

1259
01:44:24.837 --> 01:44:26.574
It's... Sorry.

1260
01:44:27.974 --> 01:44:32.946
Spring water
with special properties.

1261
01:44:33.447 --> 01:44:34.615
Oh.

1262
01:44:34.747 --> 01:44:37.551
Okay.

1263
01:44:37.685 --> 01:44:40.119
- Okay.
- What does it do?

1264
01:44:40.254 --> 01:44:41.422
Oh, um...

1265
01:44:41.854 --> 01:44:43.090
It, uh...

1266
01:44:43.224 --> 01:44:45.759
It breaks down your defenses

1267
01:44:45.893 --> 01:44:49.829
and opens you
for the influence.

1268
01:44:50.698 --> 01:44:51.966
Okay.

1269
01:44:53.535 --> 01:44:55.035
Thanks.

1270
01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:57.071
You're welcome.

1271
01:44:58.005 --> 01:45:00.007
You know what? Um...

1272
01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.509
I'm worried
I'll have a bad trip.

1273
01:45:01.643 --> 01:45:04.946
Oh, no, no. You won't.
You won't. Trust me.

1274
01:46:48.619 --> 01:46:51.887
- I don't speak Swedish.
- What?

1275
01:47:19.917 --> 01:47:21.986
What? What?

1276
01:47:30.829 --> 01:47:32.363
What's happening?

1277
01:47:34.332 --> 01:47:37.669
You are our May Queen.

1278
01:47:38.404 --> 01:47:39.937
- Me?
- Yes!

1279
01:47:40.071 --> 01:47:41.607
- Why?
- You won!

1280
01:47:42.907 --> 01:47:44.443
What does that mean?

1281
01:47:44.576 --> 01:47:45.911
What? Oh.

1282
01:48:35.863 --> 01:48:38.164
Mom? Mom?

1283
01:48:39.466 --> 01:48:42.703
Oh, my God, Dani! May Queen!

1284
01:51:20.932 --> 01:51:21.933
Herring?

1285
01:51:22.366 --> 01:51:23.635
What for?

1286
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:27.006
It's tradition. For good luck.

1287
01:51:27.138 --> 01:51:28.573
Yeah.

1288
01:51:28.707 --> 01:51:31.476
- What?
- And you must eat it whole.

1289
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:34.145
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no!

1290
01:51:34.278 --> 01:51:36.081
You must try!

1291
01:51:36.214 --> 01:51:38.216
- You must try!
- Ahhh!

1292
01:51:48.494 --> 01:51:50.595
Very good try.

1293
01:51:53.799 --> 01:51:55.166
Excuse me...

1294
01:51:56.468 --> 01:51:58.004
What's going on?

1295
01:52:06.578 --> 01:52:08.480
Why did you do that?

1296
01:52:15.387 --> 01:52:17.589
To our May Queen!

1297
01:52:20.793 --> 01:52:22.662
<i>Skal!</i>

1298
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:36.409
You are the family now! Yes?

1299
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:38.878
Yes, you are the family.

1300
01:52:39.311 --> 01:52:40.613
Like sisters.

1301
01:53:53.387 --> 01:53:56.491
Your dance was amazing.

1302
01:53:56.625 --> 01:53:59.294
I've never seen someone
dance like that.

1303
01:54:12.507 --> 01:54:14.944
Now, it's traditional
for the May Queen

1304
01:54:15.077 --> 01:54:17.980
to bless our crops
and livestock.

1305
01:54:19.415 --> 01:54:21.617
And after the luck
you just inherited

1306
01:54:21.751 --> 01:54:23.286
from that salt herring,

1307
01:54:23.418 --> 01:54:25.988
we should all be
doubly encouraged.

1308
01:54:39.535 --> 01:54:41.336
Can Christian
come with me?

1309
01:54:42.104 --> 01:54:43.206
Nay.

1310
01:54:43.339 --> 01:54:44.907
The Queen must ride alone.

1311
01:57:20.267 --> 01:57:21.802
Repeat after me.

1312
01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:09.618
Breathe in.

1313
01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.189
For your vitality.

1314
02:02:38.394 --> 02:02:40.430
We shall go now
to Siv's house.

1315
02:02:40.962 --> 02:02:42.230
What's this?

1316
02:02:42.364 --> 02:02:45.133
It is a special meeting,
only for the Queens.

1317
02:02:45.268 --> 02:02:46.736
And she will bless you.

1318
02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:51.708
What's that?

1319
02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.376
That's not for us.

1320
02:02:58.981 --> 02:03:00.350
I think you should not.

1321
02:04:49.662 --> 02:04:51.497
No, no, no.

1322
02:09:42.996 --> 02:09:44.364
Christian?

1323
02:09:45.198 --> 02:09:46.967
Christian.

1324
02:09:50.037 --> 02:09:51.304
Hi.

1325
02:09:52.639 --> 02:09:54.942
Hello, there you are.

1326
02:09:55.275 --> 02:09:56.643
Listen.

1327
02:09:56.778 --> 02:10:00.249
You can't speak.
You can't move.

1328
02:10:01.082 --> 02:10:02.449
All right?

1329
02:10:03.151 --> 02:10:04.451
Good.

1330
02:10:14.695 --> 02:10:19.735
On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

1331
02:10:19.868 --> 02:10:23.238
we gather
to give special thanks

1332
02:10:23.371 --> 02:10:25.373
to our treasured sun.

1333
02:10:25.506 --> 02:10:27.843
As an offering to our father,

1334
02:10:27.976 --> 02:10:32.647
we will today surrender
nine human lives.

1335
02:10:33.681 --> 02:10:37.986
As Harga takes,
so Harga also gives.

1336
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:42.791
Thus, for every
new blood sacrificed,

1337
02:10:42.925 --> 02:10:46.662
we will dedicate
one of our own.

1338
02:10:47.563 --> 02:10:50.833
That is four new bloods.

1339
02:10:51.432 --> 02:10:52.935
Four from Harga.

1340
02:10:53.902 --> 02:10:57.307
And one to be chosen
by the Queen.

1341
02:10:57.439 --> 02:11:00.576
Nine in all to die

1342
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:05.148
and be reborn
in the great cycle.

1343
02:11:05.281 --> 02:11:09.219
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1344
02:11:09.351 --> 02:11:14.557
As for our end, we have two
already dedicated

1345
02:11:17.493 --> 02:11:20.629
and two who have volunteered.

1346
02:11:21.496 --> 02:11:23.867
Ingemar and Ulf.

1347
02:11:27.037 --> 02:11:29.873
You have brought
outside offerings.

1348
02:11:30.773 --> 02:11:34.677
Plus volunteering
your own bodies.

1349
02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:39.249
You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

1350
02:11:40.251 --> 02:11:44.554
And to Pelle,
who has brought new blood

1351
02:11:44.688 --> 02:11:46.824
and our new May Queen,

1352
02:11:46.957 --> 02:11:52.162
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1353
02:11:52.296 --> 02:11:56.901
And so,
for our ninth offering,

1354
02:11:57.035 --> 02:12:00.436
it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

1355
02:12:00.571 --> 02:12:02.773
between a preselected
new blood

1356
02:12:02.907 --> 02:12:06.577
and a specially-ordained
Hargan.

1357
02:12:32.504 --> 02:12:34.039
Turbeyon.

1358
02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:38.576
Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

1359
02:12:43.115 --> 02:12:44.183
And...

1360
02:13:02.768 --> 02:13:04.970
Christian Hughes.

1361
02:13:07.773 --> 02:13:09.474
These are the candidates

1362
02:13:09.608 --> 02:13:12.011
for the ninth
and final offering.

1363
02:13:13.579 --> 02:13:16.682
We patiently await
your verdict.

1364
