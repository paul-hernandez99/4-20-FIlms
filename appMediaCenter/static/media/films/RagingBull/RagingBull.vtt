1
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.970
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.170
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.110
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.540
'cause one night,

5
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.710
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.940
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.620
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.890
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.290
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.160
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.460
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve...

12
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.540
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.400
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.480
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.120
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.810
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.750
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.260
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.330
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.990
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.040
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.770
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.380
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.470
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.670
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.050
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.450
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.680
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.690
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.960
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.690
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.960
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.900
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.970
Just like home...
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.870
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.240
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.410
Help!

38
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.980
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.050
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.850
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.980
La Motta fighting
out of a halfcrouch.

42
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.090
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.160
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.820
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.440
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.440
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.440
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.170
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.180
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.720
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.050
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.660
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.790
Reeves is up again,
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.060
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.790
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.900
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.010
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.370
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.480
Two... three...

60
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.080
four... five...

61
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.680
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.810
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.420
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.590
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.590
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.120
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.090
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.530
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.500
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.760
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.300
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.040
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.710
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.680
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.810
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.060
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.530
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.570
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.500
You won... let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.300
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.710
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.750
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.920
Help!

84
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.330
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.930
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.970
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.300
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.340
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.670
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.240
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.240
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.970
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.410
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.420
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.350
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.420
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.420
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.420
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.620
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.530
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.530
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.290
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.360
They knew.

104
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.900
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.370
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.280
The people knew.

107
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.720
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.790
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.820
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.090
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.660
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.730
Is it done?

113
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.200
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.000
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.240
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.080
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.240
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.410
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.650
Bring it over!

120
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.850
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.360
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.130
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.730
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.800
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.460
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.440
That's... there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.140
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.210
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.150
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.050
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.650
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.280
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.680
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.990
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.460
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.060
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.890
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.300
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.400
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.400
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.510
Yeah?

142
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.400
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.410
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.350
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.150
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.950
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.920
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.580
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.990
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.690
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.700
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.830
What's the matter with you,

153
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.500
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.610
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.830
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.340
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.110
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.650
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.950
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.560
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.490
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.650
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.260
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.390
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.060
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.070
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.970
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.570
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.810
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.810
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.970
What'd I do?

172
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.150
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.650
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.260
You can't, I'm telling you...

175
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.120
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.490
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.860
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.730
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.810
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.530
What's wrong?

181
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.840
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.320
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.290
My hands.

184
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.960
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.460
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.700
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.340
Know what that means?

188
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.570
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.150
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.480
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.950
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.820
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.860
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.160
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.530
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.660
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.540
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.770
It's not normal.

199
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.610
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.520
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.090
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.090
Forget about it.

203
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.320
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.430
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.970
We have fights all the time...
are you worried now?

206
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.190
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.630
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.740
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.140
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.080
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.410
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.580
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.150
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.150
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.050
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.830
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.530
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.430
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.230
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.030
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.270
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.610
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.440
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.850
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.050
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.120
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.490
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.680
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.460
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.220
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.130
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.500
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.000
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.370
- That's enough with that...
- Take it off.

235
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.600
Come on.

236
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.830
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.530
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.270
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.470
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.380
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.140
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.780
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.400
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.940
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.280
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.850
How you doin'?

247
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.580
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.650
Joey.

249
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.650
Come here.

250
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.860
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.160
Looks mad.

252
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.700
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.740
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.100
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.300
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.510
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.580
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.820
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.930
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.370
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.210
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.720
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.680
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.910
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.150
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.200
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.960
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.060
Is that what you're talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.260
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.270
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.430
What are ya,
a jerk there?

273
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.100
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.580
What the fuck

275
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.680
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.580
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.030
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.140
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.040
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.710
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.430
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.490
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.100
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.130
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.300
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.340
What's her last name?

287
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.930
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.310
She knows them?

289
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.380
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.150
Everybody knows each other...
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.380
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.860
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.720
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.920
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.090
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.930
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.730
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.070
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.610
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.210
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.840
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.780
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.510
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's...

304
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.590
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about... she's not like that.

305
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.280
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.620
You know, it's...

307
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.960
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.120
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.670
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.740
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.930
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.370
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.840
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.010
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.410
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.180
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.520
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.280
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.360
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.260
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.160
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.230
- That's...
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.030
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.140
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.530
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.040
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.440
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.550
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.600
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.310
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.850
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.790
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.260
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:03.620
Big shot.

335
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.960
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot...

336
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.360
without his gun.

337
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.300
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.140
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.810
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.820
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.320
Big shot.

342
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.990
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.230
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.560
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.670
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.830
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.570
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.640
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.510
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.740
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.350
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.440
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.780
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.120
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.660
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.120
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.350
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.900
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.760
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.460
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.970
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.870
You and your fuckin' ass...
you, too ya... go out!

363
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.600
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.070
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.080
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.840
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.450
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.650
Jack.

369
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.970
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.600
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.370
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.100
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.440
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.950
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.450
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.720
- Hello, Joe. How you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.830
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.260
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.630
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.140
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.570
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.440
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.980
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.710
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.540
D'you put money
in the basket this week?

386
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.330
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.730
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.040
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.110
Go ahead.

390
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.260
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.870
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.230
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.030
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.540
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.940
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.840
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.890
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.090
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.790
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.690
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.130
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.630
There.

403
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.410
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.640
Hi.

405
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.480
How you doin'?

406
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.150
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.930
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.900
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.100
Where you from?

410
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.740
Around here.

411
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.810
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.620
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.950
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.580
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.820
Okay.

416
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.300
Move over.

417
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.250
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.820
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.690
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.920
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.690
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.200
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.770
You see it?

424
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.810
No.

425
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.170
What does that mean?

426
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.170
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.470
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.810
Daddy?

429
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.580
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.560
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.470
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.280
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.170
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.120
Salute.

435
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.570
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.740
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.830
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.900
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.770
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.700
That's better.

441
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.310
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.820
Some water?

443
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.000
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.330
All right.

445
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.940
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.130
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.570
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.240
What else?

449
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.750
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.460
That's a bird.

451
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.030
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.770
The restroom.

453
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.490
Sit down.

454
00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.140
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.540
I know.

456
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.340
You look good, though.

457
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.360
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.320
I don't know.

459
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.660
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.500
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.370
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.410
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.740
for their second fight.

464
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.810
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.470
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.150
You can see the contrast
in their styles...

467
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.420
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.550
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.460
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.820
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.030
both hands to the head.
A left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.860
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.740
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point, 10-rounder.

474
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.900
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.510
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.950
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose,

477
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.180
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.190
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.350
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.590
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.410
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.810
The undefeated Sugar Ray...
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.040
La Motta coming at him again,
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.080
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.060
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.060
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.840
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.770
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull,

489
00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.400
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.210
his first loss as a professional
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.480
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.520
the impossible...
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.780
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.410
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.460
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.390
Come here.

497
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.000
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.300
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.810
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.800
Come here.

501
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.320
Come here.

502
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.360
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.800
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.780
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.770
Make it better.

506
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.330
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.630
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.220
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.290
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.520
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.440
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:07.760
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.100
What?

514
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.500
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.290
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.670
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.300
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.830
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.070
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.670
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.110
meet for the third time.

522
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.620
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.350
These two men...
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.790
dangerous... so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.830
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.260
They've each won one,

527
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.590
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.660
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.200
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points.

530
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.110
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.040
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.150
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.450
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.820
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.580
- Robinson trying to get up.
...six... seven...

536
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.920
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.030
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.800
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.230
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.030
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.410
Your attention, fans.

542
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.170
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.080
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.740
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.080
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.090
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.420
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.960
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.560
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.140
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'...

551
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.310
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.870
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.570
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.450
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.080
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.550
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.180
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.600
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.730
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.100
Forget about all that shit...
this was your shot.

561
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.830
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:17.170
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.610
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.990
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.250
You sure?

566
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.880
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.260
Yeah, child, I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.500
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.660
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.710
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.040
Look at that... 168 pounds.

572
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.340
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.610
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.810
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.820
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.780
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.720
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.880
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.360
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.460
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.720
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.360
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.370
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you...

584
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.060
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:42.230
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.870
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.240
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.650
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.150
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.780
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.150
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:01.590
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.360
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.330
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.330
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.800
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.600
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.430
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.270
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:17.140
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.370
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.570
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.710
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.880
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.950
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.320
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.690
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.320
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.120
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.460
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.620
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.030
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:45.660
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.970
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.440
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.740
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.440
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.310
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.970
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.580
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.320
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.320
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.660
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.320
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.400
- You beat him now...
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.430
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.940
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win...
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.540
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.840
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.740
- Nothin'...
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.870
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.480
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.520
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.850
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.260
Who asked you?

636
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.990
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.060
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.790
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.270
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.960
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.410
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.070
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.940
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.980
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.150
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds...

646
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.190
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.590
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.490
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.260
- your usual diet...
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.270
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.100
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.540
Like what?

653
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.610
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.780
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.940
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.020
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.920
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.960
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.390
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.150
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.130
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.730
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:56.060
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.500
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.230
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.900
and you tell her, "What are you?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.510
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.680
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.980
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't...

670
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.050
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.210
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.020
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.390
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.460
All right.

675
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.930
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.590
Make up with her.

677
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.790
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.670
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.170
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.270
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.670
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:37.740
All right?

683
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.870
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.540
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.950
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.210
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.320
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.580
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.520
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.260
Come here.

691
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:29.530
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.760
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.200
What a great audience.

694
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:36.270
Come on, lady, laugh it up...
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.200
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.210
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.010
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:51.610
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.820
What's your name again?

700
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.430
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.320
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:10.430
He hits me with a left hook...
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.970
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.780
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:21.540
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.810
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:24.420
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.210
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.820
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:29.420
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.650
See ya later.

712
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:36.400
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.050
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.830
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.160
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.400
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.700
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.360
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.030
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.800
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.740
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.010
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.590
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.630
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.230
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.430
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.830
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.810
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.000
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.840
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.750
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.720
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:41.560
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.890
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.830
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.400
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.470
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.670
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.610
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.840
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.680
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.790
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.790
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.860
Yeah.

745
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.850
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.330
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:22.560
What do you gotta? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.360
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.100
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.170
Shall I take the?

751
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.600
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.610
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.270
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.380
I tell ya the truth, it's so...
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.660
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.390
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.260
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.770
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.530
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.040
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.040
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.450
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:15.040
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.590
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.950
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.790
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.120
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:28.200
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes,

769
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.800
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.100
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.940
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.310
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.200
I think he should.

774
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.980
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.140
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.340
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.480
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.590
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:57.420
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.290
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:04.870
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.770
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.240
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.470
Yeah?

785
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.450
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.520
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.850
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.620
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.350
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:29.360
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.620
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:35.130
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.170
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.830
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.070
I don't know, I got a problem...
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.210
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:51.580
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.240
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.410
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:56.540
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.280
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:00.360
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.650
I'll get you both in the ring
and give yous both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.320
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.530
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.900
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.670
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.410
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:56.270
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.520
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.650
No.

812
00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.060
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:17.430
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:20.770
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.370
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.040
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.210
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:36.620
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.590
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.790
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:48.130
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.300
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:10.150
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:16.510
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.280
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:48.420
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:51.820
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.420
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.730
Four pounds.

830
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.820
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:10.630
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it...

832
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.840
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.240
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.970
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.240
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.080
I don't know.
You never know these things...

837
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.920
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.950
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:28.390
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.390
Pleasure... heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.830
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.800
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:36.590
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.930
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:40.730
What ever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:43.470
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.080
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.470
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.270
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.680
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.940
He's workin' downtown,
big building... workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.380
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.920
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.750
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.880
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.550
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:04.590
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:05.720
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.350
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.490
Come on back. Okay.

861
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.270
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.740
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.070
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.770
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.650
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of you are the same.

867
01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.750
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.850
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.490
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.990
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.820
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.020
and havin' both of you
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.900
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.500
- Don't make me...
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.630
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:46.860
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.170
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.040
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.800
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:55.880
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.610
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.840
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.620
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.090
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.720
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.630
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.800
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.900
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.970
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.300
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.100
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.800
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.810
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.040
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.580
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.050
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:40.250
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.950
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.060
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.460
We're friends,
we can straighten this...

901
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.230
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:51.460
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.200
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.470
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.480
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:07.180
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.050
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.550
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:14.890
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:18.290
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.330
Hey, you fuckin'...
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.460
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.630
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:28.570
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:30.700
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.240
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.050
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.750
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.250
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.870
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.010
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.710
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:16.420
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.850
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

925
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.690
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

926
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.960
and we're gonna forget about it.

927
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.530
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.290
Right?

929
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.460
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

930
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.660
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

931
01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:37.300
and no grudges.

932
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.210
That's the most important thing...
no grudges.

933
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:42.980
Now, come on, shake hands.

934
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.190
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

935
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:51.380
All right?

936
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.420
I only wish this thing
never happened.

937
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.360
We all wish it never happened.

938
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.590
Right?
You'll get over it.

939
01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.830
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

940
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.060
Yeah, all right.

941
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.540
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

942
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.660
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

943
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.010
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

944
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:21.780
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

945
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.650
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

946
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:30.450
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

947
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.090
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

948
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:35.460
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

949
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:39.630
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

950
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:42.900
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

951
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.370
No, it's nothin' like that.

952
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:47.380
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

953
01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.450
all the fights and all.

954
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.620
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

955
01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.150
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

956
01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:00.980
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

957
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.360
and I'm lookin' very bad.

958
01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:07.330
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

959
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.920
What is it with him?

960
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:12.000
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

961
01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.730
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

962
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.840
The man's got a head of rock.

963
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.280
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

964
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.280
Jack respects you.

965
01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.890
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

966
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.250
You he talks to, he likes you.

967
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:38.350
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

968
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.470
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

969
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.930
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

970
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:46.470
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

971
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.600
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

972
01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.000
Make it on his own.

973
01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:56.170
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

974
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.750
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

975
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:03.250
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

976
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.650
That's not crazy.

977
01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:08.160
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

978
01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.390
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

979
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:15.690
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

980
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.430
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

981
01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.560
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

982
01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.230
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

983
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:26.170
Now, you're a smart kid.

984
01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.670
You go to him, you tell him...

985
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:35.110
Son of a bitch.

986
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.780
Twenty dollar shoe here.

987
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:46.960
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

988
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.300
What's the matter?

989
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.630
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

990
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.800
- Who?
- Vickie.

991
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.820
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

992
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:13.090
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

993
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:14.320
Just once.

994
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.900
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

995
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.660
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

996
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.760
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

997
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.670
'cause that's what's happenin'.

998
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.440
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

999
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.880
So, what'd that guy say?

1000
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.450
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1001
01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:51.050
The good news is

1002
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.290
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1003
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:57.630
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1004
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.740
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1005
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.270
You didn't know that was comin'?

1006
01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.000
You win some,
you lose some.

1007
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.610
This one, we're losin'.

1008
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:10.040
Billy Fox.

1009
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.380
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1010
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:21.250
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1011
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.620
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1012
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.460
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1013
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.930
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1014
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:33.040
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1015
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.940
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1016
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:37.100
and It's not good.

1017
01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.180
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1018
01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:41.110
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1019
01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.050
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1020
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.340
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1021
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.620
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1022
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.280
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1023
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.190
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1024
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:56.620
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1025
01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.520
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1026
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.130
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1027
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.700
Okay, that's it.

1028
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:03.130
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1029
01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:04.930
- That was it?
- That was it.

1030
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:16.970
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1031
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.980
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1032
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.180
feature attraction.

1033
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.850
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1034
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:28.750
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1035
01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:32.660
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1036
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.530
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1037
01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.640
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1038
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.940
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1039
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.010
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1040
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:51.550
It's all right, yeah.

1041
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.310
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1042
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.210
Five seconds, Alex.

1043
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.530
Come on, stand...
come on, stand up!

1044
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.330
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1045
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.130
Come on.

1046
01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.170
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1047
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.820
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1048
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:33.410
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1049
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.820
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1050
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.480
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1051
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.760
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1052
01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.430
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1053
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:46.760
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1054
01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.530
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1055
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.940
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1056
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.810
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1057
01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.440
Pocket your dirty money!

1058
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.610
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1059
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.280
We're stoppin' the fight!

1060
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:08.150
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1061
01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.780
And you standin' there.

1062
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.900
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1063
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:17.700
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1064
01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.200
The winner
by technical knockout,

1065
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.470
and still undefeated,

1066
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:26.580
Billy Fox!

1067
01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.850
What'd I do?!

1068
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.080
Don't fight anymore.

1069
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.990
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.160
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1071
01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:57.700
What'd I do?

1072
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.680
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview...

1073
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:11.690
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1074
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.230
Why did I do it? Why?

1075
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:24.100
They got some balls,
some balls.

1076
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:27.460
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1077
01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.560
They want me
to go down, too?

1078
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:32.180
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1079
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.870
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1080
01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.280
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1081
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:42.320
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1082
01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:45.980
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1083
01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.990
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1084
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:50.720
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1085
01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.920
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1086
01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.730
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1087
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.060
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1088
01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.390
I don't know.

1089
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.530
"Purse was withheld..." look at this...
"Purse was withheld pending

1090
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.700
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1091
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.400
Look how they make me look.

1092
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.540
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1093
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.180
A what?

1094
01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.550
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1095
01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.280
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1096
01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:18.680
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1097
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.890
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1098
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.550
What are you talkin' about?

1099
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.560
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1100
01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.890
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1101
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:29.060
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1102
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.070
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1103
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.930
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1104
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:34.970
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1105
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.970
- is if he dies, he won't be able to...
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1106
01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.250
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1107
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.150
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1108
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:52.850
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1109
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.030
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1110
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.150
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1111
01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.920
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1112
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.590
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1113
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.000
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1114
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.270
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1115
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.930
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1116
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.340
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1117
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.450
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1118
01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.180
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1119
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.180
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1120
01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.410
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1121
01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:26.080
I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.160
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1123
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.830
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1124
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.800
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1125
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:37.930
You're worried about that?

1126
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.470
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1127
01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:44.470
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1128
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.010
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1129
01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.580
Order me a piece of cake.

1130
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.580
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1131
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.310
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1132
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.420
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1133
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.020
That's good,
order me one of those.

1134
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.020
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1135
01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.350
Since when did you
order one of those?

1136
01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.860
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1137
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.090
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1138
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.330
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1139
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.370
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1140
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.600
I'm not tellin' her... personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1141
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.330
What were you tellin' her that for?

1142
01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.340
Order me a cheeseburger.

1143
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.910
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1144
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:28.350
What the f?

1145
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.550
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1146
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:32.620
Forty seconds.

1147
01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.280
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1148
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.520
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1149
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.130
Ya up?

1150
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.170
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1151
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.640
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1152
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:50.040
How are you?

1153
01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:57.480
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1154
01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.210
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1155
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.050
Thank you.

1156
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.120
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1157
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.320
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1158
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.930
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:15.090
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1160
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.700
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1161
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.130
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1162
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:19.200
No, thank you, Tommy.

1163
01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.360
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1164
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.170
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1165
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:25.570
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1166
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:27.640
See you later, everybody.

1167
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.610
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1168
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:32.220
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1169
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.440
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1170
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.420
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1171
01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.820
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1172
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.760
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1173
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:45.120
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1174
01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.960
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1175
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.070
Good-bye, honey.

1176
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:52.700
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1177
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.460
Can you believe that girl?

1178
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.900
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1179
01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.200
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1180
01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.780
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1181
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:14.150
Hey! Come here.

1182
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.220
Come here a minute.

1183
01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.260
What was all that about?

1184
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.990
All what?

1185
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.870
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1186
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.610
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1187
01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.800
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1188
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:37.610
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1189
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:40.080
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1190
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.690
- I hear.
- Hey!

1191
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.880
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1192
01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.610
You hear what I said?

1193
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.990
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1194
01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:53.860
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1195
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.590
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1196
01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:58.130
Shut up! I'll fuckin'
take care of you later!

1197
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:59.360
Shut up!

1198
01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:10.280
Disgusted with the two of you.

1199
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.180
Get to you later.

1200
01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.830
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1201
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.130
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1202
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.460
All right, let's go.

1203
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.990
Good luck, Jake!

1204
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:48.410
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

1205
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:52.070
In this corner,
the very worthy challenger,

1206
01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.620
weighing in at 1581/4 pounds,

1207
01:19:55.750 --> 01:20:00.020
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1208
01:20:06.630 --> 01:20:08.500
Shake hands,
come out fighting at the bell.

1209
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.720
Kill him!

1210
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.150
Pressure, pressure, pressure!

1211
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.310
Now finish him off.
He's all stupiada, you got him.

1212
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.970
Come on, Jake!

1213
01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.120
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall
right over for ya.

1214
01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.880
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1215
01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.520
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1216
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.990
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1217
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:12.600
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1218
01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.770
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1219
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:32.380
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1220
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.710
And the winner by
a technical knockout

1221
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.220
in the tenth round,

1222
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:39.080
and the new
Middleweight Champion of the World,

1223
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.950
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1224
01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.530
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1225
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.150
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1226
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.950
It's the worst thing you could do.

1227
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:18.660
Oh, you're home.

1228
01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:22.100
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1229
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.270
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1230
01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.270
I went out.
What's the matter?

1231
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:31.870
Television won't work.

1232
01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.210
Where'd you go?

1233
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:38.610
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1234
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:53.520
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1235
01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.690
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1236
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:57.320
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1237
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:58.400
Come on, huh?

1238
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.060
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1239
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.760
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1240
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.810
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1241
01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.530
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1242
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.780
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1243
01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:19.910
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1244
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.130
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1245
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.760
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1246
01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.660
That's it, go ahead...
forget how long it took you

1247
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.860
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1248
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.700
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1249
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:39.100
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1250
01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.270
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1251
01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.390
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1252
01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.310
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1253
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.650
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1254
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.690
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1255
01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.830
- Didn't I?
- No.

1256
01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:00.290
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1257
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:01.730
It was no big thing, anyway.

1258
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.630
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1259
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:06.930
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1260
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:09.040
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1261
01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.230
How come you
never told me about it?

1262
01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.570
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1263
01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:17.040
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1264
01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:20.880
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with... Vickie?

1265
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:24.420
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1266
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.520
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1267
01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.020
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1268
01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:34.920
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1269
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.530
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1270
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:38.600
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1271
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.260
I heard some things.

1272
01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:43.570
- You heard about me and Salvy...
- I heard things, Joey.

1273
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:46.200
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1274
01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:48.210
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1275
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:49.400
I heard some things.

1276
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:52.010
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1277
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:53.550
You know what
you should worry about?

1278
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.710
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1279
01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.750
Do that.

1280
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.650
Christ!

1281
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.930
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1282
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:12.630
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1283
01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.010
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1284
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.080
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1285
01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:22.240
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1286
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.780
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1287
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:26.180
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1288
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.910
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1289
01:25:28.050 --> 01:25:30.950
- He thinks he's a wiseguy...
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1290
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:33.080
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1291
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.750
Hey, I'm your brother.

1292
01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:36.920
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1293
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.530
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1294
01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.560
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1295
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:46.760
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1296
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.300
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1297
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.170
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1298
01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.980
You give me
that look, Joey.

1299
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:05.650
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1300
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:07.720
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1301
01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.490
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1302
01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:14.860
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1303
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.400
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1304
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:18.800
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1305
01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.770
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1306
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.700
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1307
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.710
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1308
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.710
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1309
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:31.910
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1310
01:26:32.050 --> 01:26:34.040
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1311
01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.090
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1312
01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.420
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1313
01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.350
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1314
01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:44.890
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1315
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:47.520
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1316
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.030
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you...

1317
01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.570
you included you with them.

1318
01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.110
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1319
01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.640
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1320
01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.610
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1321
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.240
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1322
01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.320
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.750
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1324
01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:13.750
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1325
01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:15.830
You ask me that?

1326
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:19.490
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1327
01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.560
Just tell me.

1328
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.270
I'm not answerin' that.

1329
01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:33.540
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1330
01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:39.340
You're very smart, Joey.

1331
01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:44.920
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1332
01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:49.380
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1333
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.890
Did you or did you not?

1334
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.500
I'm not gonna answer.

1335
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:58.530
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1336
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:00.690
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1337
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.100
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1338
01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.180
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1339
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:08.400
You're a sick bastard...
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1340
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:09.570
You know what you should do?

1341
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:12.270
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1342
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.540
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1343
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.780
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1344
01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.980
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1345
01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.790
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1346
01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:08.930
Where were ya?

1347
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:10.400
I was at my sister's.

1348
01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.170
Where'd you go after that?

1349
01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.240
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1350
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:19.910
Father of the Bride.

1351
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.320
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1352
01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.330
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1353
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:36.020
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1354
01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.390
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1355
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.470
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1356
01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:45.840
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1357
01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.380
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1358
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:49.770
- Huh?
- No!

1359
01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:57.710
Open the door.

1360
01:29:57.850 --> 01:29:59.450
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1361
01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:01.960
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1362
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:04.620
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1363
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.020
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1364
01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.260
No.

1365
01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:12.830
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1366
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:14.600
I didn't do anything!

1367
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.780
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1368
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:20.880
I fucked all of 'em!

1369
01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:23.100
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1370
01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:25.770
I fucked all of 'em... Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1371
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.540
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1372
01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.450
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1373
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:33.390
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1374
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.550
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1375
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.660
Forget fuckin' with you!

1376
01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.430
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1377
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:50.500
Where you goin'?

1378
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.170
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1379
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:55.140
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1380
01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.150
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1381
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.750
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1382
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:03.750
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1383
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:06.480
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1384
01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.620
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1385
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.660
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like...

1386
01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.990
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1387
01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:17.530
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1388
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:22.670
Get off of him!

1389
01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:29.040
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1390
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.210
Call the police!

1391
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.290
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1392
01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:40.580
Get out!

1393
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.650
Don't leave, honey, please.

1394
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:12.880
Honey, look... I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1395
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:32.090
Just...

1396
01:33:53.290 --> 01:33:55.820
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1397
01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.150
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1398
01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:01.160
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life,

1399
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:04.170
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1400
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.170
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1401
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:09.900
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1402
01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.040
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1403
01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.540
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1404
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.150
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1405
01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.910
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1406
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:25.780
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1407
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.190
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1408
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.560
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1409
01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.430
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1410
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.770
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1411
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.930
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1412
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:45.740
Six... seven...

1413
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.330
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1414
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.470
You're out!

1415
01:34:50.610 --> 01:34:51.910
It is all over!

1416
01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:54.140
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1417
01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.950
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1418
01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:59.560
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1419
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.280
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1420
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:08.620
Come on.

1421
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.630
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1422
01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:19.800
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1423
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.680
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1424
01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.650
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1425
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.090
Go ahead.

1426
01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.450
Hey, champ... like to ask
you a few questions.

1427
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.950
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1428
01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.680
- Excuse me, my wife is...
- There's a great angle here...

1429
01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.450
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1430
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:09.790
Come on. All right, champ?

1431
01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:12.620
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya?

1432
01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:24.730
Hello?

1433
01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.250
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1434
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.410
Is that you?

1435
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:38.420
I know somebody's there,
I can hear you breathin'.

1436
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.250
You listenin'?

1437
01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:45.160
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1438
01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.760
You got that?

1439
01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.900
The fight of the year.

1440
01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:40.280
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1441
01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.350
Give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1442
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.690
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1443
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:53.020
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1444
01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:57.960
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1445
01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:02.000
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1446
01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.230
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1447
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:09.340
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1448
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.040
There's the buzzer,

1449
01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:13.150
and I think you know
both the boys.

1450
01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:26.320
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1451
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.330
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1452
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.700
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1453
01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.640
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1454
01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.470
Come on! Come on.

1455
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:49.410
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1456
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:52.420
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1457
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.180
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1458
01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.960
These are clean, whistling shots.

1459
01:40:03.090 --> 01:40:05.750
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1460
01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.090
No man can endure this pummeling!

1461
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:10.960
The fight is stopped on...

1462
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.800
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1463
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:16.870
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1464
01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:18.500
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1465
01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.630
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1466
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.770
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1467
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:27.970
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1468
01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.210
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1469
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:33.340
Never went down, Ray.

1470
01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.460
You never got me down, Ray.

1471
01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.450
Ya hear me?

1472
01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.150
Never got me down.

1473
01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.700
Yeah? See, look?

1474
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:46.500
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1475
01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.470
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1476
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:51.360
And there you see it...

1477
01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:54.680
a champion gone down to defeat.

1478
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.780
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1479
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:01.820
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1480
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:04.950
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1481
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:06.490
throughout the world,

1482
01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.150
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1483
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:12.860
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1484
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.930
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1485
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.360
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner...

1486
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.440
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1487
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:24.370
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1488
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:26.370
of the thirteenth round,

1489
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:29.380
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1490
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:30.880
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1491
01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:40.420
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1492
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:43.290
It's over for me...
boxing's over for me.

1493
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:45.150
I'm through.

1494
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:48.120
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1495
01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.290
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1496
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:53.830
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1497
01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:56.340
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1498
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:58.840
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1499
01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:02.800
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1500
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:07.020
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1501
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:08.310
Take a picture, Bob.

1502
01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:11.080
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey... for us.

1503
01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:12.810
Go ahead, smile.

1504
01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:16.250
Thank you, Bob.

1505
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:19.160
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1506
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.730
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1507
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:30.800
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1508
01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.130
I think it's great.

1509
01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.570
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1510
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:36.470
He's home with us
all the time now.

1511
01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.710
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1512
01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:41.370
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1513
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.640
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1514
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:46.980
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1515
01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.060
I don't know.

1516
01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:49.950
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1517
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:04.470
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1518
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.510
Thank you.

1519
01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.880
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1520
01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:18.350
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1521
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:27.090
See how that sounds.

1522
01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.660
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.890
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1524
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:33.500
at Madison Square Garden.

1525
01:43:36.170 --> 01:43:37.640
Okay, honey.

1526
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.310
Thank you, doll.

1527
01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.270
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1528
01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:45.010
- Salute.
- Salute.

1529
01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.350
Look at this terrific girl.

1530
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:51.780
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1531
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.190
especially if he's a degenerate.

1532
01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:56.620
Did I say that?

1533
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.020
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1534
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:04.860
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1535
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.270
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1536
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:12.860
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1537
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:14.170
you're all full of shit.

1538
01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:20.050
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1539
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:22.380
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1540
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:27.050
Is she here?
She's not here.

1541
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:28.990
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1542
01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:31.750
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate...

1543
01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:34.360
it's a little different...
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1544
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.660
Thank you.

1545
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:40.000
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1546
01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.000
One was married,
one was single.

1547
01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.500
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1548
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.340
"What's the matter with you?

1549
01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:48.600
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1550
01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.510
And look at me,
and look at you."

1551
01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:55.980
Let me get on with it.

1552
01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.640
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1553
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:00.190
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1554
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.420
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1555
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.530
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1556
01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.530
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1557
01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.360
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1558
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.020
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1559
01:45:11.170 --> 01:45:13.660
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1560
01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.270
What time does
your wife get home?"

1561
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.570
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1562
01:45:23.710 --> 01:45:25.240
he would say

1563
01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:28.480
that the thing ain't the ring,

1564
01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.480
it's the play.

1565
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.080
So give me a stage

1566
01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:35.490
where this bull here can rage,

1567
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:37.490
and though I can fight,

1568
01:45:37.630 --> 01:45:39.990
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1569
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.600
That's entertainment!

1570
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.420
Jake, how have you been?

1571
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:18.560
Hey!
You were just great.

1572
01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:21.230
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1573
01:46:21.370 --> 01:46:24.340
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1574
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:26.940
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1575
01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.010
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1576
01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.240
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1577
01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.780
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1578
01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.280
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1579
01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.890
It's good seein' you.

1580
01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:42.250
That is a joke, right?

1581
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:44.590
It's a joke...
only you know if it's a joke.

1582
01:46:44.730 --> 01:46:46.320
He's just kidding, right?

1583
01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.300
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1584
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:51.160
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1585
01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.060
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1586
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.030
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1587
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:57.440
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1588
01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:01.240
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1589
01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:06.100
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1590
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.780
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1591
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:13.380
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1592
01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.780
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1593
01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.450
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1594
01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:19.580
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1595
01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:21.920
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1596
01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.330
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1597
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:25.990
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1598
01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:28.070
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1599
01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:29.730
What's the problem?

1600
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:30.860
There's really not a problem.

1601
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:33.840
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1602
01:47:34.410 --> 01:47:36.000
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1603
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:37.410
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1604
01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.780
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1605
01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.850
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1606
01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:50.860
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1607
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:52.260
What about you?
How old are you?

1608
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.760
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1609
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:56.830
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1610
01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.230
Come here.

1611
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:11.440
She's 21, too?

1612
01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.450
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1613
01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:33.930
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1614
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:36.540
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1615
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.650
There.

1616
01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.250
Come on, Jake.

1617
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:06.570
Lonely nights

1618
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:10.570
I'm so lonely

1619
01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.400
Please come home

1620
01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:17.810
You great big
lump of sugar

1621
01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.510
I miss you so much

1622
01:49:20.650 --> 01:49:22.450
Please come home

1623
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:25.520
Lonely nights

1624
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.670
It was a busy night last night.

1625
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:46.470
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1626
01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:50.010
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1627
01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:52.410
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1628
01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:56.210
- Move over.
- Why?

1629
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:58.820
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1630
01:49:58.950 --> 01:50:00.420
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1631
01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.010
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1632
01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:04.060
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1633
01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:07.190
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1634
01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.290
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1635
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:12.030
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1636
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:13.430
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1637
01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:15.970
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1638
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.230
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1639
01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:45.420
Wake up, champ.

1640
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.030
What's up?

1641
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:54.740
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1642
01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.140
- They wanna talk with you.
- You all look the same to me.

1643
01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:59.650
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1644
01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:01.720
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1645
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:04.220
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do you want?

1646
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:05.450
For what?

1647
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:11.220
Do you recognize this girl?

1648
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:14.290
She been in the club?

1649
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:20.100
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1650
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:23.500
Nah, I don't know her.

1651
01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.770
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1652
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:29.470
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1653
01:51:29.610 --> 01:51:33.880
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1654
01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:36.040
But I don't say nothin'.

1655
01:51:36.190 --> 01:51:39.050
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1656
01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:41.990
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1657
01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:44.060
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1658
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:52.320
Let me ask you somethin'.

1659
01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:56.560
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1660
01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.800
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1661
01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:02.040
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1662
01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.510
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1663
01:52:05.210 --> 01:52:07.150
For what,
because of this girl?

1664
01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.810
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1665
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:14.750
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1666
01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:16.550
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1667
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:18.280
Let me just get somethin'.

1668
01:52:19.230 --> 01:52:21.030
All right, don't make no noise.

1669
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.130
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.360
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1671
01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:29.300
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1672
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.300
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1673
01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.640
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1674
01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.040
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1675
01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.440
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1676
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:42.980
You saw the papers...
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1677
01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:45.420
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1678
01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:48.250
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1679
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:49.860
Yeah, what friends?

1680
01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:53.120
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1681
01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.590
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1682
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.010
What's the matter with you?

1683
01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:06.610
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1684
01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.800
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1685
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:11.740
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1686
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:14.820
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1687
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:18.010
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1688
01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:21.020
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1689
01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.490
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together...

1690
01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.020
Give me 2,000 for them.

1691
01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.420
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all...

1692
01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:29.430
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1693
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:32.430
- I'm sorry. I'd lose...
- Give me them.

1694
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.940
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1695
01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:38.900
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1696
01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.440
I can't raise the 10,000.

1697
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.120
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1698
01:53:47.850 --> 01:53:49.320
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1699
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:53.290
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1700
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.590
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1701
01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:02.460
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1702
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.160
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1703
01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.560
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1704
01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.970
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1705
01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:17.410
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1706
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:20.640
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1707
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.750
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1708
01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:25.580
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1709
01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.190
See it? See it?!

1710
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.320
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1711
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:32.990
Go on, boy, live in it!

1712
01:54:33.130 --> 01:54:35.890
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1713
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:37.120
Your mother's!

1714
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.030
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1715
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:45.440
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1716
01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.040
Fuck you!

1717
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:51.100
Fuck your mother!

1718
01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:31.240
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1719
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:40.090
Why? Why? Why?

1720
01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:01.050
You motherfucker!

1721
01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.450
My hands!

1722
01:56:18.370 --> 01:56:19.560
Why'd you do it, why?

1723
01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:22.070
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

1724
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.570
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1725
01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:27.070
You're so stupid.

1726
01:56:27.210 --> 01:56:30.010
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1727
01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:31.510
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:36.020
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1729
01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:40.820
I'm not that guy.

1730
01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.780
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1731
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:05.810
"Look who's here... big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1732
01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.450
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1733
01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.390
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1734
01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.460
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

1735
01:57:17.590 --> 01:57:19.060
He said, "You're in it."

1736
01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.160
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1737
01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.270
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1738
01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.370
Up yours.

1739
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:29.160
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1740
01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.900
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1741
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.400
And the horse you rode in on.

1742
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:38.400
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1743
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:40.410
Funny man.

1744
01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:42.740
That's why I'm here.

1745
01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:46.750
Give him another drink.

1746
01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.790
Piss in it for me.

1747
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:53.860
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1748
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.930
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

1749
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:59.530
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1750
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:01.800
I know you're all capable of it.

1751
01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:03.870
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1752
01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.110
Her name is Emma 48's.

1753
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:13.110
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1754
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:29.190
Taxi!

1755
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.200
Honey...

1756
01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:45.370
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1757
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:48.010
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1758
01:58:48.150 --> 01:58:49.810
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1759
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:53.150
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1760
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:56.150
Be careful.

1761
01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:12.100
Hey, what are you doin'?

1762
01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:13.470
Joey.

1763
01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:19.240
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1764
01:59:31.630 --> 01:59:33.320
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

1765
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.190
Hey, Joey, come on.

1766
01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:50.470
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1767
01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:53.670
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

1768
01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:55.580
Come on, be friends.

1769
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.210
Come on, you're my brother.

1770
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:58.820
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1771
01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:01.550
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1772
02:00:01.690 --> 02:00:02.750
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1773
02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:04.360
Give me a kiss, come on.

1774
02:00:04.890 --> 02:00:07.760
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1775
02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.330
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1776
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.930
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1777
02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:14.830
Come on.

1778
02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.600
You're my brother.
Come on.

1779
02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:26.110
Come on, give me a kiss.

1780
02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.610
- What?
- Come on.

1781
02:00:32.190 --> 02:00:34.050
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1782
02:00:34.190 --> 02:00:36.120
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1783
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:38.960
- Family?
- All right.

1784
02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.220
Come on.

1785
02:00:44.370 --> 02:00:46.300
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

1786
02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:49.840
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1787
02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:51.870
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1788
02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.010
Don't forget.

1789
02:00:55.210 --> 02:00:57.470
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1790
02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.220
...won it legitimately...

1791
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:15.350
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1792
02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.520
Some people aren't that lucky.

1793
02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:23.500
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront,

1794
02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:26.270
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1795
02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:28.270
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1796
02:01:28.410 --> 02:01:30.970
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1797
02:01:31.110 --> 02:01:32.880
And it went somethin' like this.

1798
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:38.950
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1799
02:01:39.690 --> 02:01:42.210
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1800
02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.890
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1801
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:49.720
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1802
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:51.130
"My night.

1803
02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:54.170
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

1804
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:55.630
"So, what happens?

1805
02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:59.140
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

1806
02:01:59.270 --> 02:02:01.400
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1807
02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:04.740
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1808
02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:08.680
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1809
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:12.140
"It was you, Charley.

1810
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:14.480
"You was my brother.

1811
02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:17.520
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

1812
02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:20.760
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1813
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:23.920
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

1814
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:27.830
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

1815
02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.170
"You don't understand.

1816
02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:34.430
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1817
02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:39.380
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

1818
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:43.110
"Let's face it...
it was you, Charley.

1819
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:46.950
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1820
02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.460
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1821
02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:51.950
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1822
02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.230
- You need anything?
- No.

1823
02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:55.450
You sure?

1824
02:02:56.530 --> 02:02:57.620
I'm sure.

1825
02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.130
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1826
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:27.420
Go get 'em, champ.

1827
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:39.440
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
