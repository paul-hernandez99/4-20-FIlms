Where are we
having dinner?

485
00:34:11.801 --> 00:34:14.303
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

486

Again?
Again.

487

You know, Frank, if anyone
wanted to assassinate you,

488
00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:22.145
you wouldn't be
too hard to find.

489
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:25.398
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

You never know.

493
00:34:31.487 --> 00:34:33.489
Maybe the catcher on
your Little League team.

494
00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:36.325
The catcher?
That son of a bitch,

495
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.827
he didn't get
a base hit all season.

496
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.328

You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

500
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.487
They got the biggest distribution

all down that way.

What do you think
of that, huh?

That's Nacho Contreras.

El Gordo!

He's got more cash than
anybody in this place.

507

He's a real chazer!

You know what
a chazer is?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.684
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a chazer?

511
00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:27.353
It's the Yiddish
word for "pig."

512
00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:30.481
A guy who wants
more than he needs.

513
00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:32.191
He don't fly
straight no more.

another bottle
right away, will you?

529

Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

530
00:37:17.445 --> 00:37:21.616
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

That's pretty good.

you to work for me.

We are going to do
something big next month.

We are running a string
of mules from Colombia.

be some other things.

fun to me, Frank.

You wanna dance, Frank,

549
00:38:35.898 --> 00:38:38.651
or sit here and
have a heart attack?

550
00:38:43.239 --> 00:38:47.743
Who? IVle, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

What? You want me
to dance?

554
00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:08.097
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony.
You dance.

555

I think ne's
a fucking peasant!

558

But you get a guy
like that on your side,

559
00:39:35.958 --> 00:39:38.252
he breaks his back
for you.

560
00:40:07.323 --> 00:40:08.365
What's your name?

561
00:40:08.449 --> 00:40:09.492
What?

562
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:13.287
What's your name?
Elvira what?

563
00:40:13.454 --> 00:40:14.580
Hancock.

564
00:40:14.663 --> 00:40:15.748
What?

565
00:40:15.998 --> 00:40:17.124
Hancock!

566
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:18.417
Hancock?

567
00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:23.089
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.

568
00:40:23.422 --> 00:40:24.924
Flying around.

569
00:40:27.134 --> 00:40:28.344
Where you from?

570
00:40:29.178 --> 00:40:30.262
Baltimore.

571
00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:31.347
What?

572
00:40:31.514 --> 00:40:33.349
Baltimore!
Baltimore?

573
00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:34.809
Where's that?

574
00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:37.603
Ltdoesn%
really matter, okay?

575
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:41.357
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

576
00:40:41.482 --> 00:40:43.692
I don't need
another friend,

577
00:40:43.776 --> 00:40:46.112
especially one who just
got off a banana boat.

578
00:40:47.696 --> 00:40:49.448
Banana boat?

579
00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:51.325
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.

580
00:40:51.408 --> 00:40:53.285
I don't come off
no banana boat.

581
00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:57.373
You're thinking
of someone else, maybe.

582
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:59.875
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

583
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.338
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

584
00:41:04.547 --> 00:41:06.090
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.

585
00:41:06.173 --> 00:41:07.466
Sorry.

586
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.053
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

587
00:41:11.137 --> 00:41:13.889
What is your problem, baby?

588
00:41:14.056 --> 00:41:15.224
You're good-looking.

589
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:17.393
You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs,

590
00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:19.979
a beautiful face, all these
guys in love with you.

591
00:41:20.062 --> 00:41:21.564
Only you got
a look in your eye

592
00:41:21.689 --> 00:41:24.358
like you haven't been
fucked in a year!

593
00:41:25.192 --> 00:41:26.944
Hey, José.

594
00:41:27.027 --> 00:41:30.322
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

595
00:41:30.406 --> 00:41:31.824
Now you're
talking to me, baby.

596
00:41:31.907 --> 00:41:33.659
That I like.
Keep it coming.

597
00:41:33.742 --> 00:41:36.871
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

598
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.082
Not yet, but you gotta
give me some time.

599
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:45.754
Even if I were blind,
desperate,

600

starved and begging for it
on a desert island,

601
00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:50.593
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

602
00:41:54.096 --> 00:41:55.931
That chick he's with...

603
00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.184
MANNY: Yeah?
...she likes me.

604
00:41:59.935 --> 00:42:03.272
She likes you?
How do you know?

605
00:42:03.606 --> 00:42:04.773
I know.

606
00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:09.403
The eyes, chico.
They never lie.

607
00:42:12.865 --> 00:42:14.992
Are you serious?

608
00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:16.785
Sedous?
What do you think?

609
00:42:16.952 --> 00:42:19.371
That's the boss's
lady,okay?

610
00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:20.539
You're gonna
get us killed.

611
00:42:20.623 --> 00:42:23.751
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.

612
00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:26.462
That guy's soft.

613
00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:30.090
Look in his face.

614
00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:35.763
The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.

615
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.726
Don't fucking go
crazy on me, okay?

616
00:42:41.644 --> 00:42:43.229
Just remember last year
at this time

617
00:42:43.312 --> 00:42:45.481
we were in
a fucking cage, okay?

618
00:42:45.606 --> 00:42:46.982
You remember.

619
00:42:47.983 --> 00:42:49.777
I'd like
to forget that.

620
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:52.613
I say be happy
with what you got.

621
00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.073
You be happy.

622
00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.409
Me, I want
what's coming to me.

623
00:42:57.493 --> 00:42:58.994
What's coming to you?

624
00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:03.624
The world, chico,

625
00:43:05.084 --> 00:43:07.002
and everything in it.

626
00:43:08.504 --> 00:43:09.588
Oh, man.

627
00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:44.164
This is paradise.

628
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:47.960
This is paradise,
I'm telling you.

629
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:52.715
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

630
00:43:54.174 --> 00:43:56.635
I should've come
here 10 years ago.

631
00:43:56.719 --> 00:43:59.555
I'd have been a
millionaire by this time.

632
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:03.559
By this time, I'd
have had my own boat,

633
00:44:03.642 --> 00:44:06.061
my own car,
my own golf course.

634
00:44:06.145 --> 00:44:09.064
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

635
00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:10.816
A line of blue jeans.

636
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:14.069
With my name written on the
back of chicks' asses.

637
00:44:15.696 --> 00:44:16.864
How's that?

638
00:44:17.573 --> 00:44:19.992
That sounds
completely crazy to me.

639
00:44:21.577 --> 00:44:23.078
Look at that. Look.

640
00:44:23.245 --> 00:44:25.831
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

641
00:44:25.914 --> 00:44:27.207
We're missing
the action.

642
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:29.126
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

643
00:44:30.336 --> 00:44:32.838
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

644
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:34.757
Get lost, greaseballl

645
00:44:35.883 --> 00:44:37.593
Look at that.
Ice cream?

646
00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:39.428
That's right.
You said "ice cream"?

647
00:44:39.553 --> 00:44:40.554
Girls like ice cream.

648
00:44:40.637 --> 00:44:42.765
Oh, come on.
That won't work.

649
00:44:42.848 --> 00:44:44.767
You can't
do it that way.

650
00:44:44.892 --> 00:44:47.770
You know how you pick up
chicks in this country?

651
00:44:51.774 --> 00:44:53.817
What was that?
What you just did?

652
00:44:53.901 --> 00:44:55.110
That's what you do.

653
00:44:55.944 --> 00:44:56.987
That's disgusting.

654
00:44:57.071 --> 00:44:58.030
Watch.

655
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.949
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

656
00:45:01.075 --> 00:45:03.285
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

657
00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:06.372
Figures you
wouldn't understand.

658
00:45:06.455 --> 00:45:07.623
But the women
in this country,

659
00:45:07.706 --> 00:45:09.708
when you do that,
they know.

660
00:45:09.792 --> 00:45:10.751
They know what?

661
00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:12.753
They understand.
They go crazy.

662
00:45:13.754 --> 00:45:16.215
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

663
00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:18.467
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

664
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.802
Look at that.

665

666
00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:27.059
She's looking at us.

667

You think you
can do it with her?

668
00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:33.440
I think I can.

669
00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:35.067
TONY: You want to
try it with her?

670
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:36.318
MAN NY: Why not?

671
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.029
You gonna watch me?

672
00:45:39.113 --> 00:45:40.823
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.

673
00:45:40.948 --> 00:45:42.574
You won't do it.
Watch this.

674
00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:45.452
I'm with you, man.

675
00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:47.621
I'm gonna get her.

676
00:45:50.582 --> 00:45:52.918
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

677
00:45:53.335 --> 00:45:54.420
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.

678
00:45:54.503 --> 00:45:55.796
ROYTISO!

679

You're looking
very pretty today.

680
00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:05.347
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.

681
00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:07.599
You want to see
something funny?

682
00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:09.852
Take a look over there.
See that man?

683
00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:12.354
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.

684
00:46:12.646 --> 00:46:13.772
I gotta watch my friend.

685
00:46:13.856 --> 00:46:16.525
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

686
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.026
Oh, look at that.

687
00:46:19.027 --> 00:46:20.112
You're sick!

688
00:46:20.195 --> 00:46:22.448
You see what
happened to him?

689
00:46:22.865 --> 00:46:24.783
If I wasn't
a nice guy...

690
00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:26.493
She's too big for you.

691
00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:28.537
Causing trouble
like that, come on.

692
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.039
Bitch! Lesbian!
What I try to tell you?

693
00:46:31.165 --> 00:46:32.541
What I try to tell you?

694
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:35.544
This country, you gotta
make the money first.

695
00:46:36.837 --> 00:46:39.798
Then when you get the
money, you get the power.

696
00:46:39.882 --> 00:46:43.051
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

697
00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:45.971
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

698
00:46:46.054 --> 00:46:47.723
MANNY: That's the one
I rented.

699
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.060
No. That's her, man.
There she is.

700
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:53.729
About time.

701
00:46:54.813 --> 00:46:57.149
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

702
00:46:57.232 --> 00:46:58.817
He told me
to pick you up.

703
00:46:59.485 --> 00:47:02.070
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

704
00:47:05.073 --> 00:47:08.368
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

705
00:47:10.412 --> 00:47:13.207
In that thing?
You must be kidding.

706
00:47:14.917 --> 00:47:18.045
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

707
00:47:19.755 --> 00:47:21.757
I wouldn't be
caught dead in that.

708
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.925
Oh, come on.

709
00:47:23.675 --> 00:47:28.388
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

710
00:47:29.348 --> 00:47:31.558
It looks like
somebody's nightmare.

711
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:43.403
So, you like
this better?

712
00:47:44.154 --> 00:47:45.280
Yeah.

713
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:48.617
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

714
00:47:48.825 --> 00:47:50.869
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?

715
00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:52.871
Crazy guy. Know what
ne's been doing?

716
00:47:52.955 --> 00:47:55.791
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

717
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.626
He says he's
gonna buy one.

718
00:47:57.751 --> 00:48:00.295
You do that and you won't
have any friends left.

719
00:48:00.379 --> 00:48:01.713
Not that you have
any now.

720
00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:03.549
You're gonna like
that tiger, man.

721
00:48:03.632 --> 00:48:06.552
You gonna drive around with a
tiger in your passenger seat?

722
00:48:06.635 --> 00:48:09.137
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.

723
00:48:12.558 --> 00:48:13.725
How much?

724
00:48:13.809 --> 00:48:15.310
43,000, fully equipped.

725
00:48:15.394 --> 00:48:17.020
That all?

726
00:48:17.104 --> 00:48:18.814
Machine-gun
turrets are extra.

727
00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:21.984
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

728
00:48:23.902 --> 00:48:26.321
Bulletproof this, okay?

729
00:48:26.405 --> 00:48:28.490
And this here and here.

730
00:48:29.491 --> 00:48:30.993
MANNY: Okay.
TONY: And the windows.

731
00:48:33.495 --> 00:48:36.748
Get me a phone
with a Scrambler.

732
00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:38.083
A Scrambler.

733
00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:40.669
And a radio
with scanners

734
00:48:40.752 --> 00:48:42.754
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

735
00:48:42.838 --> 00:48:44.506
Don't forget
the fog lights.

736
00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:48.510
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

738
00:48:51.597 --> 00:48:54.600
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

739
00:48:56.018 --> 00:48:58.353
I thought you were
taking me to Frank.

740
00:49:03.984 --> 00:49:06.486
We got an hour.
You hungry?

741
00:49:08.196 --> 00:49:09.990
No, but I'm bored.

742
00:49:11.033 --> 00:49:12.701
Well, that figures.

743
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.165
Check it out, Nlanny, okay?
And pay the guy.

744
00:49:18.457 --> 00:49:21.668
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

Good doing business with you.

Oh, God, man!

I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

Oh, yeah.

you, you was like that.

Then I'll be
making enough money...

806
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:47.642
Surprise!

807
00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:50.979
All that's over,
starting today.

808

Vvhy?

809
00:53:52.564 --> 00:53:54.399
My kid sister
don't have to work

810
00:53:54.482 --> 00:53:57.235
in no beauty parlor,
and Mama,

she don't have to
sew in no factory.

812
00:54:00.572 --> 00:54:02.657
Your son made it, Mama.

813
00:54:04.117 --> 00:54:05.452
He's a success.

814
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.997
That's why I didn't
come around before.

815
00:54:09.956 --> 00:54:13.835
I want you to see what
a good boy I've been.

816
00:54:16.296 --> 00:54:17.756
Here's $1,000.

for this, Antonio?

00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:30.477
Mama.

821
00:54:30.852 --> 00:54:32.812
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

822
00:54:33.772 --> 00:54:34.856
MAMA: No?
No.

823

What are you doing now?

824
00:54:38.443 --> 00:54:41.529
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

825
00:54:41.613 --> 00:54:43.865
No! Things are
different now.

826
00:54:43.949 --> 00:54:46.785
I'm working with
an anti-Castro group.

I'm an organizer now.

I get a lot of
political contributions.

829

Sure you do.

and the killings.

giving a bad name to our people,

Son? I wish I had one.

839

He's a bum.
No.

840

He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

you are?

bad things backthen_

got into some trouble.

to tell you what to do.

understand that.

Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

894
00:58:05.984 --> 00:58:07.318
Don't tell her
I gave it to you,

895
00:58:07.402 --> 00:58:09.529
but give her some
from time to time.

Come here.

901
00:58:28.006 --> 00:58:29.883
I'll talk to you again. Okay.

902
00:58:29.966 --> 00:58:32.093
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

903
00:58:32.177 --> 00:58:33.678
I'll talk to her.

904
00:58:35.597 --> 00:58:37.015
I'll talk to you.
Okay.

905
00:58:39.142 --> 00:58:40.226
Let's go.

906
00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:43.521
She's beautiful.
How come you...

907
00:58:43.605 --> 00:58:44.856
Hey!

908
00:58:47.317 --> 00:58:51.362
Stay away from her.
You hear?

909
00:58:52.155 --> 00:58:53.698
She's not for you.

910
00:58:53.781 --> 00:58:54.824
Okay.

911
00:58:57.535 --> 00:58:58.745
(ENGINE STARTING)

912
00:59:20.308 --> 00:59:22.101
So, this and my
other factory,

913
00:59:22.185 --> 00:59:23.394
I can guarantee production

914
00:59:23.478 --> 00:59:27.565
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

915
00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:30.235
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

916
00:59:30.318 --> 00:59:33.738
Basically, what I'm looking
for is somebody in the States

917
00:59:33.821 --> 00:59:36.032
who can share
the risk with me,

918
00:59:36.115 --> 00:59:37.242
somebody
who can guarantee

919
00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:41.496
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

920
00:59:41.913 --> 00:59:46.251
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr.
Sosa. Something like that...

921
00:59:47.335 --> 00:59:49.671
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

922
00:59:49.754 --> 00:59:51.673
It would've been
nice if he'd come.

923
00:59:51.756 --> 00:59:52.840
He would like to come,

924
00:59:52.924 --> 00:59:55.093
but with his trial
coming up,

925
00:59:55.176 --> 00:59:57.512
it's hard to
leave the country.

926
00:59:57.595 --> 00:59:59.430
So he sent
you instead?

927
00:59:59.514 --> 01:00:01.015
Something like that.

928
01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:03.351
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

929
01:00:03.977 --> 01:00:07.355
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

930
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.964
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me

931
01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:34.382
every month
of the year.

932
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.633
He picks it up here.

933
01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:38.011
I can sell it to him
for as little as

934
01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:43.391
7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

935
01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:47.061
But then we got to take
the risk of moving it.

936
01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:50.231
We'll be cutting out the
Colombians_ Know what that means?

937
01:00:50.315 --> 01:00:52.233
That means we have to
go to war with them.

938
01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:55.903
We out out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

939
01:00:55.987 --> 01:00:57.864
TONY: Why don't
we split the risk?

940
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:03.077
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama,

941
01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:05.663
we take it from there.

942
01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:11.419
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.

943
01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:17.342
Panama I can sell
for 13.5 a key.

944
01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:21.095
13_5?
What, are you nuts?

945
01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:26.351
13.5? We still got to take
that shit to Florida.

946
01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:28.519
Do you know what
that's like these days?

947
01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:30.730
You got the Navy everywhere.

948
01:01:30.897 --> 01:01:32.857
You got frogmen_

949
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.234
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.

950
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.113
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

951
01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:42.116
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

952
01:01:43.076 --> 01:01:45.953
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

953
01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:47.622
Forget about 13.5.

954
01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:50.792
(PHONE RINGING)

955
01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:53.961
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

956
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.594
Excuse me.
One moment.

957
01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:08.393
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

958
01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:10.144
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?

959
01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:12.480
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

960
01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:15.608
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

961
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.986
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

962
01:02:19.112 --> 01:02:20.655
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.

963
01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.657
Fuck you.
How's that?

964
01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:25.576
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

965
01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.413
OIVIAR: You need to open your
eyes and keep your mouth shut.

966
01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:29.956
That's it.
Let it go at that.

967
01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:31.416
TONY: Don't worry
about it.

968
01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:33.459
Your head's in
the wrong place.

969
01:02:33.543 --> 01:02:34.836
You must watch
out for yourself.

970
01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:36.087
Why not talk to him?

971
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.172
You think he wants
to give you the money?

972
01:02:38.256 --> 01:02:39.674
Shut the fuck up.

973
01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.843
I'm doing
the talking here, not you.

974
01:02:42.677 --> 01:02:45.346
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

975
01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.766
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

976
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:50.351
That's easier to watch.
(INAUDIBLE)

977
01:02:50.435 --> 01:02:51.853
Close your mouth.

978
01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:55.481
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

979
01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:58.651
Just shut up. I'm doing
the talking here.

980
01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:01.112
SOSA: Now where were we?

981
01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:02.363
Panama.

982
01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.032
You're looking for
a partner, right?

983
01:03:06.409 --> 01:03:07.952
Something like that.

984
01:03:08.035 --> 01:03:11.539
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're
getting ahead of ourselves.

985
01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:16.752
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

986
01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:18.963
That's my limit.
I got no right.

987
01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.256
Nobody got no right
to negotiate...

988
01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.133
Let the man
finish, okay?

989
01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:24.927
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

990
01:03:25.052 --> 01:03:27.013
You got no
authority here.

991
01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:29.891
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

992
01:03:30.016 --> 01:03:32.435
Frank is gonna love it.

993
01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:34.020
That's up to Frank,
not you!

994
01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:39.609
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Sosa.

995
01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.611
No, it is all right.

996
01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:45.406
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

997
01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:49.410
VVeH,good.

998
01:03:50.745 --> 01:03:53.915
I don't think it's something I
want to do on an overseas phone.

999
01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:57.168
But as soon as
I get back to Miami,

1000
01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.086
I will talk to
Frank personally.

1001
01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:01.255
Good.

1002
01:04:02.048 --> 01:04:04.425
My associates can escort
you to my chopper

1003
01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:06.219
to take you
to Santa Cruz.

1004
01:04:06.302 --> 01:04:09.388
I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.

1005
01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:12.475
You'll be back here
tomorrow in time for lunch.

1006
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.520
Good.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1008
01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:20.608
Good talking to you.

1009
01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:23.778
Why not leave
your friend here?

1010
01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.656
While you're gone, he can tell
me how to run my business.

1011
01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:28.449
I think Frank
wants to see him.

1012
01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:29.825
No, that's okay.

1013
01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:33.621
You tell Frank I'm keeping
this guy on ice for him.

Let's finish
our lunch.

1017
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.720
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

1018
01:04:51.097 --> 01:04:53.349
You got everything
a man could want.

1019
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:58.104
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

1020
01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:01.482
Unfortunately,
I don't feel the same

1021
01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:03.859
about the rest of
your organization.

What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

1024
01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.743
I'm talking
about Omar Suarez.

1025
01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:18.958
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch

1026
01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.295
from several years ago
in New York.

1027
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:28.718
He was an informer
for the police.

(scREAlvllNG)

1030
01:05:46.569 --> 01:05:50.865
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

1031
01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:58.289
So how do I know you're
not a chivato, too, Tony?

1032
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:02.710
Hey,Sosa.

1033
01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:07.590
Let's get this
straight now.

1034
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.471
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

1035
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:15.097
You got that?

All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

1037
01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:23.356
I don't break them for
no one, you understand?

1038
01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:27.109
That piece of shit up
there, I never liked him,

1039
01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:28.694
I never trusted him.

1040
01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:30.905
For all I know,
he had me set up

1041
01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:33.366
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

1042
01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:35.868
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

1043
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.329
You want to go on
with me, say it.

1044
01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:41.165
You don't,
then you make a move.

1045
01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:49.507
I think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

1046
01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.008

1047
01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:54.095
"This Lopez, your boss,

1048
01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:58.015
"he had chivatos like
that working for him."

1049

His judgment stinks.

1050
01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:05.064
So I think to myself,

1051
01:07:05.481 --> 01:07:08.484
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

1052

"How can I trust his organization?
" You tell me, Tony.

Frank is smart,
you know?

You can't blame him
for that animal.

It's a crazy business
we're in, you know?

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:31.632
That could happen
to anyone, even you.

1057
01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.975
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank

1058
01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:43.436
and work it out?

1059
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.272
I'll fix things
between us.

1060
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.817

can work this thing out,

we do business together
a long time.

1063

Just remember,

1064
01:08:01.704 --> 01:08:03.873
I'll only tell you
one time,

1065

don't fuck me, Tony.

try to fuck me.

FRANK: You What?

1068
01:08:29.023 --> 01:08:32.526
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million

1069
01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:33.944
without even
checking with me?

01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:36.113
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

Coho. Take it easy.
Coho, my ass!

At 10.5 a key,
it's puro.

1073

You can't lose money.
No way.

1074

on this deal.

going to do

with the first 5 million?

What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

01:09:04.141 --> 01:09:06.477
He'll send
a hit squad up here!

There'll be
a war in the street.

Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

You short a couple of mil,
I go on the street for you.

of moves,

Okay?

1087
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:29.625
You've been making moves
on your own?

1088
01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.839
I got ears, you know.
I hear things.

1089
01:09:38.592 --> 01:09:41.554
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

1090
01:09:41.637 --> 01:09:43.848
What about Gomez?

1091
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:46.267
What'll he do when you
start moving 2,000 keys...

1092
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:50.271
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

1093
01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:51.605
Fuck them all!

1094
01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.692
I'll bury
those cockroaches!

1095
01:09:56.277 --> 01:09:58.028
What they ever do for us?

1096
01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:08.831
Look, Frank,
the time has come.

1097
01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:12.001

We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

1101
01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:27.141
We gotta think big now.

1102
01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:33.022
Think big.

1103
01:10:39.028 --> 01:10:40.738
Like your friend Sosa.

1104
01:10:43.157 --> 01:10:46.493
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

1105
01:10:47.036 --> 01:10:49.663
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

1106

You turn your back on
him, he'll stick it in.

1107
01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.339
You don't trust
a guy like that.

1108
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.092
You want me
to believe

1109
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:06.889
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

1110
01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:08.933
You bought that line?

1111
01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:13.062
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

1112
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:17.733
Maybe you and Sosa know
something I don't know.

1113
01:11:20.861 --> 01:11:22.029
Like What?

1114
01:11:23.238 --> 01:11:24.657
Like What?

1115
01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:28.410
You tell me,
"Like what."

1116
01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:35.167
You calling me
a liar, Frank?

1117
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:37.962
That what you're
calling me?

1118
01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:45.594
Let's just say
I want things

1119
01:11:45.678 --> 01:11:47.721
to stay the way
they are for now.

1120
01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:53.644
You stall your deal
with Sosa.

1121
01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.647
Stall it?

1122
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.569
Okay, boss.

1123
01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:04.279
Come on.

1124
01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:07.992
I am the boss.

1125
01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.536
Sure, you're the boss.

1126
01:12:10.619 --> 01:12:11.787
Hey, Tony.

1127
01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:18.752
Remember I told you
when you started,

1128
01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:21.422
the guys who last
in this business

1129
01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:24.508
are the guys
who fly straight,

1130
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.302
low-key, quiet.

1131
01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.639
And the guys
who want it all,

1132
01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:34.643
chicas, champagne, flash,

1133
01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:38.063
they don't last.

1134
01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:40.858
You finished?

1135
01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:42.985
Can I go now?

1136
01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:07.009
Hi, there.

1137
01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:15.976
You just missed Frank.

1138
01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:20.272
Too bad.

1139
01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.735
Only I didn't
come to see Frank.

1140
01:13:26.278 --> 01:13:29.198
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

1141
01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:31.158
Next time,
make an appointment.

1142
01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.284
That's okay.

1143
01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:35.496
I got something important I
want to talk to you about.

1144
01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:45.005
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

1145
01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.840
act normal,

1146
01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:50.969
and just take it easy?

1147
01:13:51.804 --> 01:13:53.680
Come on.
I like Scotch.

1148
01:13:58.602 --> 01:13:59.978
Sure. Why not?

1149
01:14:00.062 --> 01:14:01.855
Okay.
I won't bite you.

1150
01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:06.527
We're all normal here.

1151
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.992
I heard you and Frank aren't
working together anymore.

1152
01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:15.702
That's right.

1153
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.543
I think it's easier,
don't you?

1154
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.003
Makes things easier.

1155
01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:28.674
Thank you.

1156
01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:32.136
Here's to
the land of opportunity.

1157
01:14:33.178 --> 01:14:34.638
For you, maybe.

1158
01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:40.894
You like kids?

1159
01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:43.856
Kids?

1160
01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:46.733
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

1161
01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.571
Sure. Why not?

1162
01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:52.489
As long as
there's a nurse.

1163
01:14:52.573 --> 01:14:55.534
Good, 'cause
I like kids, too.

1164
01:14:57.494 --> 01:15:01.582
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

1165
01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:07.045
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.

1166
01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:09.047
Come here.

1167
01:15:16.096 --> 01:15:17.097
Sit here.

1168
01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:19.433
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

1169
01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:21.268
I'm not gonna bite you.

1170
01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:29.067
Okay, here's the story.

1171
01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:35.532
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

1172
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.955
I got no education,
but that's okay.

1173
01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.459
I know the street,

1174
01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:48.045
and I'm making
all the right connections.

1175
01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:52.716
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

1176
01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:55.594
I could go
right to the top.

1177
01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:01.808
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

1178
01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.562
I like you.

1179
01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:11.652
I liked you the first time
I laid eyes on you.

1180
01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:17.574
I said, "She's a tiger.

1181
01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:21.828
"She'll belong to me."

1182
01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.251
Anyway,

1183
01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:30.337
I want you
to marry me.

1184
01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:36.343
I want you to be the
mother of my children.

1185
01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:42.182
Me? IVlarry you?

1186
01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:43.517
That's right.

(slGHs)

1188
01:16:48.272 --> 01:16:50.023
What about Frank, Tony?

1189
01:16:50.691 --> 01:16:52.276
What will you do
about Frank?

1190
01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:55.946
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

1191
01:16:58.282 --> 01:17:00.867
Just think
about it, okay?

1192
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.538
I want you to
really think about it.

1193
01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:10.168
I'll go now.
Take care.

All your enemies
are gone.

01:17:22.014 --> 01:17:23.265
Mr. Montana.
How are you?

1197
01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:24.558
Hello.

1198
01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.276
What the fuck
she doing here?

MANNY: Come on, man.
She's just dancing.

1200
01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:38.739
Come on.
Take it easy.

1201
01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:54.129
It's just a disco.

1202
01:17:54.212 --> 01:17:55.422
Who's that guy
she's with?

1203
01:17:56.631 --> 01:17:59.009
MANNY: He's some guy who works for Luco.
He's nobody.

1204
01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:00.802
He's harmless.
Works for Luco?

1205
01:18:00.886 --> 01:18:03.347
Yeah. Forget him.

Hello, Tony.
You remember me?

Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?

1209
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.487
Chief Detective,
Narcotics.

1210
01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:22.074
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

1211
01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:25.369
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?

1212
01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:28.914
I ain't killed nobody,
not lately.

1213
01:18:29.331 --> 01:18:31.124
No, not lately.

1214
01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:34.961
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

1215
01:18:35.045 --> 01:18:38.215
Or a bunch of whacked-out
Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?

1216
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.927
Wnoever's giving you
your information

1217
01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:43.720
is taking you
for along ride.

1218
01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:45.222
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1219
01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:47.682
Tony, baby,
we gonna talk,

1220
01:18:47.766 --> 01:18:50.685
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls

1221
01:18:50.769 --> 01:18:52.145
here and now?

1222
01:18:58.026 --> 01:18:59.611
Keep your eye on her.

1223
01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:02.197
MANNY; I'll do that.
TONY: Okay.

1224
01:19:03.949 --> 01:19:05.951
My office.
Good.

1225
01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:17.337
The word on the street is you're
bringing in a lot of yeyo.

1226
01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:20.090
That means you're not a
small-time punk anymore,

1227
01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:22.050
you're public
property now.

1228
01:19:22.134 --> 01:19:24.970
Supreme Court says that your
privacy can be invaded.

1229
01:19:25.053 --> 01:19:26.805
Okay. How much?

1230
01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:29.724
How much?

1231
01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:32.894
There's an answer
to that, too.

1232
01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:40.861
Here's how much.

1233
01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:43.405
Can you see it?

1234
01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:47.325
Big number.
Yeah!

1235
01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:50.412
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1236
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.581
You know
how this works?

1237
01:19:54.499 --> 01:19:55.917
No. You tell me.

1238
01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:58.920
We tell you who's
moving against you,

1239
01:19:59.296 --> 01:20:02.090
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1240
01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:06.303
Let's say that you got a real
problem making a collection.

1241
01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:09.598
And then we step in
for you.

1242
01:20:10.015 --> 01:20:12.350
Got eight killers with
badges working for me.

1243
01:20:12.434 --> 01:20:13.727
When they hit, it hurts.

1244
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:15.520
Same thing
works the other way.

1245
01:20:15.604 --> 01:20:17.689
You feed me
a bust now and then.

1246
01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:21.318
Some cowboy setting
himself up in business.

1247
01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:24.237
Small fry, you know?

1248
01:20:28.033 --> 01:20:29.659
We like snacks.

1249
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:33.288
How do I know you're the last
cop I'm gonna have to grease?

1250
01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:38.710
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

1251
01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:42.464
How do I know what rock they're
gonna crawl out from under?

1252
01:20:42.547 --> 01:20:45.383
Well, that's not
my business, Tony.

1253
01:20:45.467 --> 01:20:46.760
We don't cross no lines.

1254
01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:50.847
You think I want
this conversation

1255
01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:52.724
going any farther
than this table?

1256
01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:56.436
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1257
01:20:56.728 --> 01:20:58.730
I don't want to
see them embarrassed.

1258
01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:00.690
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1259
01:21:00.774 --> 01:21:03.485
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

1260

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1261
01:21:06.071 --> 01:21:08.448
You understand
what I'm talking about?

1262
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.116
Huh?

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.794

By the way,

1265
01:21:26.174 --> 01:21:28.176
I got a vacation
coming up.

1266
01:21:28.385 --> 01:21:30.887
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1267
01:21:30.971 --> 01:21:32.430
We've never been there.

1268
01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:35.809
So throw in a couple of
round-trip tickets, first class.

1269
01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:45.944
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

1270
01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:48.989
Every day above ground
is a good day.

1271
01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:03.837
Hello.

1272
01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:07.340
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.

Okay, IVlel.

1274
01:22:11.553 --> 01:22:13.513
You think about
what I said?

1275
01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:15.348

in 45 minutes.

1433

on the phone. Let's go.

Yeah, Tony.

to do for me,

"We fucked up,
he got away."

1460

they won
the division tonight.

1461

That's great.
Congratulations.

There always is, Tony.

1473

I'll bet it was
the Diaz brothers.

1474

to the Sun Ray thing.

Maybe you're right,
you know?

Anyway, I'm glad
you made it, Tony.

for you in spades.

for, Tony?

Tony, why the fuck
would I hurt you?

1498

I brought you in.

1499

So we had a few
differences, no big deal.

1500
01:37:02.735 --> 01:37:05.654
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1501
01:37:05.738 --> 01:37:07.907
I stayed loyal to you.

1502

I made what I could
on the side,

1503
01:37:11.994 --> 01:37:13.704
but I never
turned on you, Frank!

You're sitting in it.

All right, Tony.
I was the one.

Please, give me
a second chance.

1511

Will you do that?
Please?

1512

I'll give you $10 million.

01:47:40.455 --> 01:47:43.375
The fact is, I can't take
any more of your money

1589
01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:45.794
unless I raise
the rates on you.

1590
01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.256
You gonna raise the...
I gotta do it.

1591
01:47:49.339 --> 01:47:50.507
The IRS is coming...

1592
01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:53.260
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.

1593
01:47:53.343 --> 01:47:54.386
I'm talking.

1594
01:47:54.469 --> 01:47:56.972
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1595
01:47:57.055 --> 01:47:58.223
This is business talk.

1596
01:47:58.306 --> 01:47:59.599
Let me explain
something.

1597
01:47:59.683 --> 01:48:02.144
The IRS is coming down
heavy on South Florida.

1598
01:48:02.227 --> 01:48:04.646
There was a TIME magazine
story that didn't help.

1599
01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:06.189
There's a recession.

1600
01:48:06.273 --> 01:48:08.608
I got stockholders I got
to be responsible for.

1601
01:48:08.692 --> 01:48:09.818
I got to do it, Tony.

1602
01:48:09.901 --> 01:48:11.111
You'll learn from him.

1603
01:48:11.194 --> 01:48:14.573
I got to go 10% on the first 12
million in denominations of 20.

1604
01:48:14.656 --> 01:48:16.658
I'll go 8%
on your $10 bills,

1605
01:48:16.741 --> 01:48:17.784
6% on your fives.

1606
01:48:17.868 --> 01:48:19.661
We'll go somewhere else.
That's it.

1607
01:48:19.744 --> 01:48:21.913
There's no place
else to go.

1608
01:48:21.997 --> 01:48:23.290
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

1609
01:48:23.373 --> 01:48:26.376
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1610
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:29.254
Once, maybe.
Then what?

1611
01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:32.174
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank

1612
01:48:32.257 --> 01:48:34.342
with 20 million of
your hard-earned dollars?

1613
01:48:34.426 --> 01:48:36.261
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

1614
01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:37.929
Who else can you trust?

1615
01:48:38.013 --> 01:48:40.807
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.

1616
01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:42.726
Huh?

1617
01:48:45.604 --> 01:48:47.355
Did you hear that guy?

1618
01:48:47.731 --> 01:48:50.400
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1619
01:48:50.483 --> 01:48:51.693
Stay with us.

1620
01:48:51.776 --> 01:48:54.863
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

1621
01:48:57.282 --> 01:48:58.450
And I got to run.

1622
01:48:58.533 --> 01:48:59.659
I'm safe but poor.

1623
01:49:01.077 --> 01:49:03.038
How's married life
treating you?

1624
01:49:03.121 --> 01:49:04.206
Better than you are.

1625
01:49:04.289 --> 01:49:05.665
(LAUGHS)

1626
01:49:05.749 --> 01:49:08.919
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

1627
01:49:09.002 --> 01:49:11.546
I'll see you.
Take care.

1628
01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:12.714
You, too.

1629
01:49:26.102 --> 01:49:27.562
That prick!

1630
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:30.815
Fucking WASP whore.

1631
01:49:31.858 --> 01:49:35.070
Talking to me like I'm some
maricén who came over on a boat.

1632
01:49:35.153 --> 01:49:36.613
(sNIFFs)

1633
01:49:36.738 --> 01:49:40.075
I tell you what.
We don't need that smiling motherfucker.

1634
01:49:40.158 --> 01:49:43.662
We should talk to this Jewish
guy, Seidelbaum, okay?

1635
01:49:43.995 --> 01:49:47.958
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

1636
01:49:48.667 --> 01:49:50.210
And he's connected.

1637
01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:55.674
Fuck them.
Mob guys. Guineas.

1638
01:49:56.925 --> 01:49:58.468
I don't trust them.

1639
01:50:17.779 --> 01:50:20.615
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1640
01:50:21.074 --> 01:50:24.703
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

1641
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:27.455
Look at that.

1642
01:50:27.539 --> 01:50:28.707
What?

1643
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:30.917
That cable truck there.

1644
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:33.920
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

1645
01:50:36.214 --> 01:50:38.800
What? You been watching
it for three days?

1646
01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.013
The thing has been there
for three days.

1647
01:50:43.096 --> 01:50:44.889
What am I gonna do,
not look at it?

1648
01:50:45.473 --> 01:50:47.142
What, you think
it's cops, right?

1649
01:50:47.225 --> 01:50:48.351
I don't know.

1650
01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.855
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1651
01:50:53.690 --> 01:50:56.609
Maybe.
I'll check it out, okay?

1652
01:50:56.693 --> 01:50:57.777
You check it out.

1653
01:50:57.861 --> 01:51:01.364
Then we're gonna blow that
fucking truck back to Colombia!

1654
01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:05.994
Come on. We're not the only
dopers living on the block.

1655
01:51:06.077 --> 01:51:07.412
Okay? Remember that.

1656
01:51:07.495 --> 01:51:10.498
That truck could be
anybody and anything.

1657
01:51:10.582 --> 01:51:11.958
It could be
a cable company...

1658
01:51:12.042 --> 01:51:14.377
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1659
01:51:14.461 --> 01:51:17.130
For someone who's in
charge of my security...

1660
01:51:17.547 --> 01:51:20.592
Here are the keys
to the front door.

1661
01:51:20.675 --> 01:51:22.552
Go down there.
Give them the keys!

1662
01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:24.346
I'm just trying
to say something.

1663
01:51:24.429 --> 01:51:27.474
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1664
01:51:27.557 --> 01:51:28.683
I don't give a fuck.

1665
01:51:28.767 --> 01:51:31.394
It's 12% of our
adjusted gross.

1666
01:51:31.478 --> 01:51:32.687
12% isn't peanuts.

1667
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:33.938
I don't give a fuck!

1668
01:51:34.022 --> 01:51:36.483
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

1669
01:51:36.566 --> 01:51:37.817
Okay?
You worry about it.

1670
01:51:37.901 --> 01:51:38.943
I am worried about it.

1671
01:51:39.027 --> 01:51:41.780
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

1672
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.867
Our thinking, our fucking
attitude, you know?

1673
01:51:46.076 --> 01:51:47.869
We're not
fucking hungry anymore.

1674
01:51:48.453 --> 01:51:50.580
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1675
01:51:50.663 --> 01:51:52.582
New construction.
New jobs.

1676
01:51:52.791 --> 01:51:55.627
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.

1677
01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:58.338
We've put your money
to work for 75 years,

1678
01:51:58.421 --> 01:52:00.465
building a more
prosperous Miami.

1679
01:52:00.882 --> 01:52:02.926
Count on us
being here tomorrow.

1680
01:52:03.009 --> 01:52:06.179
TONY: That's because for 75 years,
you been fucking everybody.

1681
01:52:06.471 --> 01:52:10.141
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1682
01:52:10.475 --> 01:52:13.061
I mean, charging me
10 points on my money.

1683
01:52:13.144 --> 01:52:15.438
They're getting
away with it.

1684
01:52:15.522 --> 01:52:16.940
Fuck, there's no
laws anymore.

1685
01:52:17.023 --> 01:52:18.483
Forget it.
Anything goes.

1686
01:52:18.566 --> 01:52:20.443
They been around
1,000 years.

1687
01:52:20.527 --> 01:52:22.654
They got all
the angles figured out.

1688
01:52:23.154 --> 01:52:26.157
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1689
01:52:26.282 --> 01:52:28.410
ELVIRA: True capitalist
if ever I met one.

1690
01:52:29.119 --> 01:52:30.203
Uh-oh.

1691
01:52:30.286 --> 01:52:32.038
Did you hear that?

1692
01:52:33.331 --> 01:52:35.333
How would you know,
bubblehead?

1693
01:52:36.042 --> 01:52:38.628
You ever do nothing besides
get your hair fixed

1694
01:52:38.711 --> 01:52:39.963
and powder your nose?

1695
01:52:40.130 --> 01:52:42.674
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1696
01:52:42.757 --> 01:52:44.884
Nothing exceeds
like excess.

1697
01:52:45.343 --> 01:52:47.762
You should
know that, Tony.

1698
01:52:47.846 --> 01:52:48.888
I should know what?

1699
01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.641
What should I know?

1700
01:52:51.766 --> 01:52:54.394
Why do you have to talk to
me like that all the time,

1701
01:52:54.477 --> 01:52:55.937
like I got to
know something?

1702
01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:57.397
Let me talk to you.

1703
01:52:57.689 --> 01:52:59.023
Listen.
What time is it?

1704
01:52:59.107 --> 01:53:00.400
This Seidelbaumm

1705
01:53:00.775 --> 01:53:02.026
6255.

1706
01:53:02.193 --> 01:53:03.278
Okay.

1707
01:53:03.361 --> 01:53:04.571
I met with this
guy Seidelbaumu.

1708
01:53:04.654 --> 01:53:08.116
The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...

1709
01:53:08.575 --> 01:53:10.869
He's good for a laugh,
this guy.

1710
01:53:10.952 --> 01:53:15.165
With a small /aw-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent

1711
01:53:15.248 --> 01:53:19.836
on an estimated
$ 1 00-billion-e-year business?

1712
01:53:20.545 --> 01:53:22.422
It seems at times
all you can do

1713
01:53:22.505 --> 01:53:24.549
is put your finger
in the dike and pray.

1714
01:53:24.632 --> 01:53:26.468
Put your fingers
in a dyke?

1715
01:53:26.801 --> 01:53:29.053
The only place
you can get your fingers

1716
01:53:29.137 --> 01:53:30.513
is in some dyke.

1717
01:53:31.347 --> 01:53:33.558
...not by outlawing
the substances,

1718
01:53:33.683 --> 01:53:36.144
but by legalizing
and taxing them.

1719
01:53:36.478 --> 01:53:41.608
These voices say that will drive
out the organized crime element.

1720
01:53:42.275 --> 01:53:44.444
I am not one
of those voices.

1721
01:53:44.527 --> 01:53:46.237
I know that.
But you know why?

1722
01:53:46.321 --> 01:53:49.157
'Cause you got your head
up your cu/o, that's why.

1723
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.576
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1724
01:53:51.659 --> 01:53:54.746
...splendor of our city
at its best.

1725
01:53:55.038 --> 01:53:56.706
TONY: It's those guys, man!

1726
01:53:56.789 --> 01:53:58.958
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,

1727
01:53:59.042 --> 01:54:01.294
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal

1728
01:54:01.377 --> 01:54:03.046
so they can make
the fucking money

1729
01:54:03.129 --> 01:54:04.797
and then get
the fucking votes!

1730
01:54:04.881 --> 01:54:08.092
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1731
01:54:08.384 --> 01:54:10.261
They fuck anything
and anyone.

1732
01:54:10.345 --> 01:54:13.431
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?

1733
01:54:13.598 --> 01:54:16.267
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1734
01:54:16.351 --> 01:54:20.396
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1735
01:54:20.522 --> 01:54:22.106
You're boring.
Oh.

1736
01:54:22.565 --> 01:54:25.818
"Money_" That's all I
hear in this house.

1737
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:29.072
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicansl

1738
01:54:29.155 --> 01:54:30.198
Here it is.

1739
01:54:30.281 --> 01:54:31.824
Frank never
talked about money.

1740
01:54:36.204 --> 01:54:38.665
That's 'cause
he was so smart.

1741
01:54:42.877 --> 01:54:45.046
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

1742
01:54:45.922 --> 01:54:47.590
You know what
you're becoming?

1743
01:54:47.674 --> 01:54:51.094
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1744
01:54:51.177 --> 01:54:54.556
Who the fuck you calling a "spio
," you white piece of bread?

1745
01:54:54.639 --> 01:54:56.140
Get out of the way
of the TV!

1746
01:54:56.224 --> 01:54:58.977
Dig a hole in the garden,
bury it, and forget about it.

1747
01:54:59.227 --> 01:55:02.480
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1748
01:55:06.401 --> 01:55:08.778
Somebody should've
given it to you.

1749
01:55:08.861 --> 01:55:10.321
You would've
been a nicer person.

1750
01:55:12.448 --> 01:55:14.492
Know what your
problem is, pussycat?

1751
01:55:14.576 --> 01:55:16.160
What is my problem?

1752
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:19.414
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1753
01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:23.293
Why don't you get
a job or something?

1754
01:55:23.793 --> 01:55:25.712
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1755
01:55:26.546 --> 01:55:29.424
Work with blind kids, Iepers.
That kind of thing.

1756
01:55:30.842 --> 01:55:33.011
Anything beats
lying around all day

1757
01:55:33.094 --> 01:55:34.596
waiting for me
to fuck you!

1758
01:55:35.221 --> 01:55:37.724
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1759
01:55:37.807 --> 01:55:39.934
No? Frank was better?

1760
01:55:41.227 --> 01:55:42.729
You're an asshole!

1761
01:55:43.605 --> 01:55:45.565
Where you going?
Come here!

1762
01:55:46.232 --> 01:55:48.484
Elviel

1763
01:55:49.193 --> 01:55:50.528
I was kidding!

1764
01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:53.573
I was only kidding!

1765
01:55:53.656 --> 01:55:55.950
I guess
sometimes married life

1766
01:55:56.034 --> 01:55:57.910
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

1767
01:55:58.119 --> 01:55:59.579
Where you going?

1768
01:55:59.662 --> 01:56:00.663
I got a date.

1769
01:56:01.539 --> 01:56:03.166
You got a date? Come here. Yeah.

1770
01:56:08.296 --> 01:56:10.381
What?

1771
01:56:10.465 --> 01:56:11.507
This Seidelbaum thing.

1772
01:56:12.216 --> 01:56:13.801
Yeah, it's all set up.

1773
01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.179
Yeah, well,
you forget it.

1774
01:56:16.262 --> 01:56:18.264
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.

1775
01:56:18.348 --> 01:56:21.100
Stay out of it? it's my deal.
I set it up.

1776
01:56:21.392 --> 01:56:23.770
You're not a negotiator,
Ivlanny, you know that.

1777
01:56:23.853 --> 01:56:26.272
You like the ladies
more than the money.

1778
01:56:26.356 --> 01:56:27.398
That's your problem.

1779
01:56:27.482 --> 01:56:30.401
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1780
01:56:30.485 --> 01:56:32.904
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing,

1781
01:56:32.987 --> 01:56:34.530
who're you gonna trust?

1782
01:56:34.614 --> 01:56:35.865
Junior partner.

1783
01:56:37.325 --> 01:56:38.409
Bullshit, man.

1784
01:56:38.493 --> 01:56:40.870
Don't talk to me about
trust, I don't like it.

1785
01:56:41.579 --> 01:56:44.040
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1786
01:56:44.123 --> 01:56:45.833
You are an asshole, man!

1787
01:56:46.793 --> 01:56:49.128
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1788
01:56:50.338 --> 01:56:51.798
Fuck you, man!

01:56:52.882 --> 01:56:56.386
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1790
01:56:57.553 --> 01:56:59.764
Who do I trust? IVle!

1791

I don't need ner. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1797
01:57:20.118 --> 01:57:22.328
Back then I worked in
pictures down in Colombia.

1798
01:57:22.412 --> 01:57:25.164
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?

1799
01:57:25.581 --> 01:57:27.834
You saw me with
Marlon Brando?

1800
01:57:27.917 --> 01:57:29.001
You know,
we're good friends.

1801
01:57:29.127 --> 01:57:30.294
I was his driver.

1802
01:57:30.378 --> 01:57:31.504
No shit?

1803
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:32.714
Brando.

1804
01:57:32.797 --> 01:57:35.675
They shot it there.
Cartagena.

1805
01:57:36.134 --> 01:57:37.969
Gillo Pontecorvo_
He was the director.

1806
01:57:38.094 --> 01:57:39.178
Italian guy.

1807
01:57:39.303 --> 01:57:41.097
Tell me about him.

1808
01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.974
I also know
Paul Newman.

1809
01:57:43.433 --> 01:57:44.434
I worked with him
in Tucson.

1825
01:58:26.058 --> 01:58:29.187
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1826
01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:31.981
I'll count it
again for you.

NICK: He probably knows me.

1837
01:59:00.426 --> 01:59:02.011
You ask him.

1838

Go against the wall,
turn around.

1845
01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:40.591
You're not kidding.

1846
01:59:40.716 --> 01:59:43.886
You're under arrest for
violation of the RICO Statute.

1847
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:45.638
You have the right
to remain silent.

1848
01:59:45.763 --> 01:59:48.307
Anything you say can and
will be taken against you.

1849
01:59:48.432 --> 01:59:50.142
How do I know
you guys are cops?

1850

What's that say, asshole?

1851
01:59:53.312 --> 01:59:56.315
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1852
01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:57.859
You call yourself
a Cuban?

1853
01:59:57.942 --> 01:59:59.777
You make a real
Cuban throw up!

1854
01:59:59.902 --> 02:00:02.071
Call your dog

SEIDELBAUIVI: Lot of good
he's gonna do you.

1857
02:00:05.783 --> 02:00:07.994
You see that eye
there in the clock?

1858
02:00:08.327 --> 02:00:10.288
Say, "Hi, honey."

1859
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:13.374
That's pretty cute.
Look at that.

1860
02:00:13.457 --> 02:00:15.668
You jerk off in front

pain in the ass.

1863
02:00:20.339 --> 02:00:22.133
All right, Benny,

1864
02:00:23.134 --> 02:00:25.678
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1865
02:00:25.845 --> 02:00:28.014
I know all that
bullshit, Seidelbauml

1866
02:00:28.139 --> 02:00:29.473
Save your breath.

1867

You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1868

I'm changing dollar
bills, that's all.

You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

100 grand, plus 300 in cash.

1874
02:00:59.837 --> 02:01:02.590
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1875
02:01:03.507 --> 02:01:06.510
They're gonna come back
at us on a tax evasion,

1876
02:01:07.595 --> 02:01:09.388
and they'll get it.

1877
02:01:13.351 --> 02:01:15.686
So, what am I
looking at here?

1878
02:01:17.939 --> 02:01:20.149
Five years.
You'll be out in three.

1879
02:01:20.232 --> 02:01:22.902
Maybe less,
if I can make a deal.

1880
02:01:24.528 --> 02:01:26.072
Three fucking years!

1881
02:01:28.449 --> 02:01:29.742
For what?

1882
02:01:30.785 --> 02:01:32.662
Washing money?

1883
02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:34.288
The fucking country was
built on washed money.

1884
02:01:34.372 --> 02:01:35.748
Can't be that bad.

1885
02:01:35.873 --> 02:01:36.958
It's not like Cuba.

1886
02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:38.292
What the fuck
you talking?

1887
02:01:38.376 --> 02:01:40.127
The jails

You kidding me or what?

1889

I'll delay the trial.

1891
02:01:44.757 --> 02:01:47.843
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1892
02:01:47.927 --> 02:01:49.095
Fuck you, man!

1893
02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.180
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1894
02:01:51.263 --> 02:01:53.099
No way. I been there.

1895
02:01:58.729 --> 02:02:00.106
Okay, look.

Okay, now that's $800,000.

1897
02:02:07.113 --> 02:02:10.282
With that kind of money, you
can buy the Supreme Court.

1898
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:16.414
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1899
02:02:17.331 --> 02:02:19.750
I'm an expert at
raising that doubt.

1900
02:02:19.834 --> 02:02:21.502
But when you got
1.3 million

1901
02:02:21.627 --> 02:02:24.839
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,

1902
02:02:25.506 --> 02:02:27.842
honey baby, it's hard
to convince a jury

1903
02:02:27.925 --> 02:02:29.510
you found it
in a taxicab_

1904
02:02:53.117 --> 02:02:55.661
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1905
02:02:55.786 --> 02:02:56.871
I really appreciate it.

1906
02:02:56.954 --> 02:02:58.664
It's okay.
How's Elvira?

1907
02:02:58.956 --> 02:03:00.875
Oh, great.
How's your wife?

1908
02:03:00.958 --> 02:03:02.043
Three more months.

1909
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:03.377
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

1910
02:03:03.461 --> 02:03:04.628
How about you?

1911
02:03:04.712 --> 02:03:07.423
When you gonna have another
Tony to take your place?

1912
02:03:07.506 --> 02:03:08.591
I'm working on it.

1913
02:03:08.674 --> 02:03:10.509
You have to
work harder. Come.

1914
02:03:10.676 --> 02:03:13.054
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1915
02:03:17.975 --> 02:03:19.268
This is Pedro Quinn,

1916
02:03:19.351 --> 02:03:21.353
chairman of the Andes
Sugar Corporation.

1917
02:03:21.479 --> 02:03:22.772
Pleasure meeting you.

1918
02:03:22.855 --> 02:03:23.939
Nice to meet YOU.

1919
02:03:24.023 --> 02:03:27.401
General Edward Strasser, Commander
of the First Army Corps.

1920
02:03:27.777 --> 02:03:28.819
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1921
02:03:28.903 --> 02:03:30.112
Pleasure.

1922
02:03:30.196 --> 02:03:32.239
This is Ariel Bleyer,

1923
02:03:32.364 --> 02:03:35.326
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1924
02:03:37.495 --> 02:03:41.415
And here is our friend Charles
Goodson from Washington.

1925
02:03:41.707 --> 02:03:42.750
Nice to meet YOU.

1926
02:03:42.833 --> 02:03:44.335
How do you do,
Mr. Montana?

1927
02:03:45.377 --> 02:03:46.879
SOSA: Sit here, Tony.

1928
02:03:50.674 --> 02:03:51.926
Gentlemen.

1929
02:03:55.846 --> 02:03:57.765
I would like to
discuss something

1930
02:03:57.848 --> 02:03:59.850
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1931
02:04:01.185 --> 02:04:02.895
You have a problem, Tony.

1932
02:04:03.729 --> 02:04:06.941
We have a problem.

1933
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:10.861
I think together we can
solve all our problems.

1934
02:04:13.114 --> 02:04:15.658
We all know you have tax
troubles in your country

1935
02:04:15.741 --> 02:04:18.452
and that you may have
to do a little time.

1936
02:04:19.078 --> 02:04:20.663
We have friends
in Washington

1937
02:04:20.746 --> 02:04:23.833
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1938
02:04:23.916 --> 02:04:27.461
You may have to pay some
back taxes, a big fine,

1939
02:04:28.254 --> 02:04:30.381
but there will be
no prison.

1940
02:04:31.048 --> 02:04:32.049
Okay.

1941
02:04:32.967 --> 02:04:34.927
So what's
your problem, Alex?

1942
02:04:35.970 --> 02:04:37.763
I'll show you
my problem.

1943
02:04:38.305 --> 02:04:41.475
INTERVIEWER: I've heard about financial
support your government receives

1944
02:04:41.559 --> 02:04:43.394
from the drug industry
in Bolivia.

1945
02:04:43.477 --> 02:04:46.772
Well, the irony of this
is that this money,

1946
02:04:46.897 --> 02:04:48.399
which is
in the billions,

1947
02:04:48.607 --> 02:04:50.359
is coming
from your country.

1948
02:04:50.442 --> 02:04:54.280
You are the major purchaser
of our national product,

1949
02:04:54.405 --> 02:04:56.157
which is cocaine.

1950
02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.492
INTERVIEWER: On one hand, you're
saying the U.S. government

1951
02:04:58.576 --> 02:05:00.703
is spending millions
to eliminate

1952
02:05:00.786 --> 02:05:02.913
the flow of drugs
onto our streets.

1953
02:05:03.164 --> 02:05:04.790
At the same time,

1954
02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:07.751
we are doing business
with the same government

1955
02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.504
that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.

1956
02:05:10.838 --> 02:05:13.424
Let me show you a few
of the other characters

1957
02:05:13.507 --> 02:05:15.759
that are involved
in this tragic comedy.

1958
02:05:15.843 --> 02:05:18.262
My organization
just recently traced

1959
02:05:18.345 --> 02:05:21.140
a large purchase
by this man.

1960
02:05:21.807 --> 02:05:25.436
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.

1961
02:05:25.686 --> 02:05:28.939
He is the Minister of the
Defense of Bolivia, my country.

1962
02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.859
And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago

1963
02:05:31.942 --> 02:05:36.780
bought a $12 million villa on
Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1964
02:05:37.281 --> 02:05:38.532
Now, if Cucombre
is supposed to be

1965
02:05:38.616 --> 02:05:39.742
the Bolivian
Defense Minister,

1966
02:05:39.825 --> 02:05:42.077
what is he doing
living in Switzerland?

1967
02:05:42.161 --> 02:05:43.662
Guarding cash registers?

1968
02:05:44.788 --> 02:05:47.750
This man here,
Alejandro Sosa,

1969
02:05:47.833 --> 02:05:49.126
a very interesting character.

1970
02:05:49.335 --> 02:05:51.003
He's a wealthy landowner,

1971
02:05:51.128 --> 02:05:53.672
educated in England,
very good family.

1972
02:05:53.964 --> 02:05:57.968
But this man is the business
brain and drug overlord

1973
02:05:58.219 --> 02:06:00.971
of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.

1974
02:06:01.055 --> 02:06:03.641
He's not your
ordinary drug dealer.

1975
02:06:04.183 --> 02:06:06.227
INTERVIEWER:
Well, discussing it openly...

1976
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:07.728
(svvlTCHEs OFF Tv)

1977
02:06:07.978 --> 02:06:10.397
He's scheduled
for 60 Minutes next.

1978
02:06:10.981 --> 02:06:16.528
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1979
02:06:17.112 --> 02:06:20.032
People everywhere are
starting to listen to him.

1980
02:06:20.491 --> 02:06:22.201
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1981
02:06:24.411 --> 02:06:26.705
That is our problem.

1982
02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:31.585
You remember Alberto,
don't you?

1983
02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:34.630
How could I forget him?

1984
02:06:35.339 --> 02:06:38.717
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1985
02:06:39.718 --> 02:06:42.096
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

1986
02:06:43.889 --> 02:06:45.849
But he doesn't
speak English.

1987
02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:49.603
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1988
02:06:49.853 --> 02:06:51.814
He needs a little help.

1989
02:06:54.024 --> 02:06:55.943
Is that a problem, Tony?

1990
02:07:01.865 --> 02:07:03.492
No problem.

1991
02:07:06.036 --> 02:07:07.162
Good.

1992
02:07:22.469 --> 02:07:26.473
So whats the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1993
02:07:26.849 --> 02:07:29.852
You gonna tell me what
happened with Sosa, or what?

1994
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:33.355
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

1995
02:07:34.231 --> 02:07:35.399
Politics.

1996
02:07:40.195 --> 02:07:43.490
I want you to stay
down here for a while.

1997
02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.410
Run things for me.

1998
02:07:47.161 --> 02:07:49.330
I gotta go to
New York next week.

1999
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:56.920
Fuck this, man.

2000
02:07:57.046 --> 02:07:59.923
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

2001
02:08:00.049 --> 02:08:01.717
You don't like it?

2002
02:08:04.762 --> 02:08:08.015
You got me into this
mess in the first place.

2003
02:08:08.098 --> 02:08:11.852
With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?

2004
02:08:11.935 --> 02:08:13.270
With Seidelbaum?

2005
02:08:13.395 --> 02:08:15.606
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

2006
02:08:15.689 --> 02:08:18.442
How do you connect
those two?

2007
02:08:18.859 --> 02:08:21.445
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

2008
02:08:21.570 --> 02:08:23.614
I'm not hungry.

2009
02:08:24.281 --> 02:08:25.366
You're not hungry?

2010
02:08:25.449 --> 02:08:27.284
Do you even know
about the trial?

2011
02:08:27.451 --> 02:08:29.161
What did you
order it for, then?

2012
02:08:29.244 --> 02:08:31.580
I lost my appetite.

2013
02:08:36.752 --> 02:08:38.295
Do you even know
that Sheffield said

2014
02:08:38.379 --> 02:08:40.547
he can get you
a postponement?

2015
02:08:41.465 --> 02:08:42.674
(sNIFFING)

2016
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:52.101
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

2017
02:08:55.312 --> 02:08:58.732
Eating, drinking,

2018
02:08:59.233 --> 02:09:01.402
fucking, sucking...

2019
02:09:01.485 --> 02:09:02.820
Come on, man.

2020
02:09:02.903 --> 02:09:04.238
Snorting?

2021
02:09:04.321 --> 02:09:05.489
Then what?

2022
02:09:07.157 --> 02:09:08.992
Tell me. Then what?

2023
02:09:09.952 --> 02:09:14.456
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

2024
02:09:15.833 --> 02:09:18.627
You got tits,
you need a bra.

2025
02:09:19.461 --> 02:09:21.004
They got hair on them.

2026
02:09:22.256 --> 02:09:25.592
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it

2027
02:09:25.676 --> 02:09:27.761
and you're eating
this fucking shit

2028
02:09:28.262 --> 02:09:31.807
and you're looking like these
rich fucking mummies in here.

2029
02:09:32.015 --> 02:09:34.685
Come on. it's not so bad.
It could be worse.

2030
02:09:35.352 --> 02:09:36.687
Is this what
it's all about?

2031
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:37.855
Forget it.

2032
02:09:38.021 --> 02:09:41.024
This what I work for?
Tell me.

2033
02:09:46.613 --> 02:09:47.865
Look at that.

2034
02:09:48.949 --> 02:09:50.284
Ajunkie.

2035
02:09:52.035 --> 02:09:56.415
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

2036
02:09:57.583 --> 02:10:01.378
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.

2037
02:10:03.046 --> 02:10:04.339
Wakes up
with a Quaaludem

2038
02:10:04.423 --> 02:10:05.716
Don't pick on her, man.

2039
02:10:05.841 --> 02:10:09.553
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

2040
02:10:11.221 --> 02:10:13.640
I can't even
have a kid with her.

2041
02:10:13.724 --> 02:10:16.435
Her womb
is so polluted,

2042
02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:19.521
I can't even have a fucking
little baby with her!

2043
02:10:19.605 --> 02:10:21.940
You son of a bitch!

2044
02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:24.568
You fuck!

2045
02:10:24.902 --> 02:10:26.320
You shouldn't talk
like that.

2046
02:10:26.403 --> 02:10:28.614
How dare you talk
to me like that!

2047
02:10:29.907 --> 02:10:32.284
What makes you
so much better than me?

2048
02:10:32.743 --> 02:10:34.036
What do you do?
Don't worry.

2049
02:10:34.119 --> 02:10:36.371
You deal drugs
and you kill people.

2050
02:10:36.455 --> 02:10:37.748
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.

2051
02:10:38.415 --> 02:10:40.751
Real contribution
to human history.

2052
02:10:40.876 --> 02:10:42.252
Go ahead.
