1
00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:36.953
And now, from New York,
The Jerry Langford Show...

2
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:41.624
...with Jerry's guests:
Tony Randall, Richard Dreyfuss...

3
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.629
...Rodney Dangerfield, Dr. Joyce Brothers,
Lou Brown and the orchestra...

4
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.465
...and little old me, Ed Herlihy.

5
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.969
And now say hello to Jerry!

6
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.953
Thank you. Good evening.
You look like a great audience.

7
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:23.499
Louis, how are you? Lou Brown
and the marvelous Langford orchestra.

8
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:24.792
Group.

9
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.672
- Um, Ed, how are you tonight?
- Very well.

10
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.174
Wonderful. I'm sorry I woke you.

11
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:35.970
I shall adhere to your request, sir.

12
00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:46.856
You want Jerry's autograph?
Give me the books.

13
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.192
Give me the books, give me the books. Okay.

14
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.323
- Have him write something personal.
- Half an hour. Goodbye.

15
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:01.704
I'll give you Mia Farrow for it.

16
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:05.875
I'm not gonna give you anything else.
I'm not wasting my time going in to get it.

17
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.461
- Hi, Rupert.
- Hello, Rupert.

18
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.046
- Who'd you get?
- Nobody.

19
00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:12.882
I got Rodney Dangerfield.
I'll trade for Barbra.

20
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.344
- You're wasting your time.
- Robin Williams.

21
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:18.679
Sidney, it's not my whole life.

22
00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.390
That supposed to mean it's my whole life?

23
00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.561
It's not my whole life. It's not my whole life,
that's right. It's yours, but not mine.

24
00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:50.837
Jerry, it's me! I love you!

25
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.843
Don't go, Jerry! No! No!

26
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.436
Will you stop shoving, please?
Will you stop pushing?

27
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.026
I'm not gonna take this, Jerry! No!

28
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.557
Jerry! Jerry!

29
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.227
Please.

30
00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:06.490
Okay! Stand back! Stand back!
Please let Mr. Langford get some air!

31
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.292
Didn't you get my message?

32
00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:28.554
Come on, people.

33
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:33.434
Jerry, I'm sorry. I don't mean to disturb you.
I just wanna talk to you for a minute.

34
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.312
- This is not the time.
- If we could just drive away.

35
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.689
You can drop me off anywhere.

36
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.193
No, I have a very strict rule
about people getting in the car.

37
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.198
I hate to bring this up, and I don't mean to be
rude, but I did put myself on the line for you.

38
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.743
- Go ahead, Harvey. Hit it.
- Jerry! Jerry!

39
00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.002
Here.

40
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.171
Thanks.

41
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.423
- Is that your initials?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:10.221
I just wanna tell you,
my name is Rupert Pupkin.

43
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.433
I know the name doesn't mean very much
to you, but it means an awful lot to me, and...

44
00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.481
- Calm down. Take your time.
- I'm a little nervous.

45
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:26.403
You might have wondered who I am.
I've been outside your show many times.

46
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:31.826
I'm in communications now, but the point I'm
trying to make is, by nature I'm a comedian.

47
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:37.248
You're gonna say, "Not another one."
But, believe me, I'm very good. I'm dynamite.

48
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:41.418
I wouldn't take one minute of your time
if I wasn't convinced I'm dynamite.

49
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:45.714
You're probably wondering, "If he's so good,
how come he hasn't caught my act?"

50
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.718
That's a very good question,
and I'll tell you why. You know why?

51
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:55.516
I've been biding my time, slowly and
carefully, so that when my big break came...

52
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:59.061
Like the night when Jack Paar got sick?
Your big break?

53
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.565
That was the night that convinced me
I wanted to be a comedian.

54
00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.192
I walked out of that show
like I was in a dream.

55
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.571
After that, I caught
all your guest appearances on Sullivan.

56
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:13.200
I studied everything you did. The way
you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed.

57
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:16.579
How you delivered the jokes
without leaning too much on them.

58
00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.415
How you didn't say,
"Hey, folks, here's the punch line."

59
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.917
You know, Jerry?
You know what I'm talking about?

60
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.921
You don't say, "Folks, here's the punch line."
You just do the punch line.

61
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.591
Exactly. That's what I loved
about what you did.

62
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.261
So, what I'm trying to say is that,
you see, now I'm ready.

63
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.763
I'm ready, and I've finished the course.

64
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:40.102
And I'm thinking as I'm sitting here now,
maybe this is my big break, my big chance.

65
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.687
You know what I mean?

66
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.733
What do you think?

67
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.655
- What'd you say your name was?
- Rupert Pupkin.

68
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:55.284
All right, look, pal. Gotta tell you...

69
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.705
...this is a crazy business, but it's not unlike
any other business. There are ground rules.

70
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:03.626
You don't just walk on
to a network show without experience.

71
00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:08.923
It's an old hackneyed expression, but it's
the truth: you've got to start at the bottom.

72
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.760
- That's where I am, at the bottom.
- That's a perfect place to start.

73
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.346
I know that, but there's gotta be a...

74
00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:20.309
Ah, it looks so simple to the viewer at home,
those things that come so easily...

75
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:24.438
...that are so relaxed and look like
it's a matter of just taking another breath.

76
00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:28.734
It takes years and years and years
of honing that and working it and...

77
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.988
There's only one problem.
I don't mean to interrupt you. I'm 34 years old.

78
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:38.953
That's why I'm asking you if you'll listen to
my act and tell me what you think about it.

79
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.455
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you call my office?

80
00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:45.793
- All right, okay. I could do that.
- You ask for Cathy Long. She's my secretary.

81
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.170
- And we'll make time to listen to you.
- Uh...

82
00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:52.341
You know how many times
I've had this conversation in my head?

83
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.594
- Did it always turn out this way?
- Yeah, it did, heh.

84
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.891
I really believe this. I think once you get over
the initial shyness, you're gonna be okay.

85
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.643
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

86
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.648
- I hope it works out for you.
- Thanks, Jerry. Thanks a lot.

87
00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.858
It's a pleasure meeting you, Jerry.

88
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.360
Jerry?

89
00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:15.990
I'm short on cash, but if you don't mind just
appetizers, I'll take you to dinner sometime.

90
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.785
I got people waiting. I don't know
what my schedule is. Maybe we can.

91
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.370
Thanks, Jerry, thanks.

92
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.038
Jerry! Jerry.

93
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:25.749
Let me show you a picture
of my pride and joy.

94
00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:31.213
- That's good. It is.
- That's good, isn't it?

95
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.132
Hey, Jerry, take it.

96
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.678
Take it. Go ahead. Take it.
Consider it a gift. It'll work for you.

97
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.391
- I will.
- Not that you need the help, heh.

98
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.894
Jerry. Seriously,
you ever want lunch, my treat.

99
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.940
- Call my office.
- Okay, okay, okay.

100
00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:53.235
Okay. Jerry, you're a prince.

101
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.879
Hey, Rupe, before I forget,
I really appreciate you meeting me for lunch.

102
00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.965
I know how busy you are
and how tired you are.

103
00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.344
What are friends for, Jerry?

104
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.058
You're the one who looks tired.

105
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.685
Yeah, I know. It's the show.

106
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:32.691
The pressure, the ratings,
the same guests, same questions.

107
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:39.323
- I'm just not enjoying it anymore.
- That's... the worst.

108
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:47.414
Listen, I really wish
you would think about it again, okay?

109
00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.417
You're starting again.
You're starting up again.

110
00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:54.296
- It's not that big a deal to think.
- I am thinking. I'm thinking.

111
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.965
That's all I do, is think day and night.

112
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.843
How can I not think about it?
I'm here at lunch with you...

113
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.679
...which I knew was the reason
you invited me...

114
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.933
...and all I'm sitting here for
is to get guilty with you, right?

115
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:10.521
I'm asking you to take over the show
for six weeks. I mean, what's six weeks?

116
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:15.484
Anything, but don't ask me to do six weeks.
I can't take over the show for six weeks.

117
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.153
I can't even take over
my own life for six weeks.

118
00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:21.115
And you're asking me to do
something that's impossible!

119
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.659
- It's impossible.
- Rupert!

120
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:26.995
- What?
- What are you doing down there so late?

121
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:32.000
It's impossible! I'm trying to tell you that.
You want the tears to come out of my eyes?

122
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.838
There's gotta be a way you can work it out.
It's just six weeks.

123
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.174
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Pupkin?
Do you think you could?

124
00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.342
Yeah.

125
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.303
- Sure. What's your name, dear?
- Dolores.

126
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.931
Dolores? That was my father's name.

127
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.436
"To Dolores, who sensed greatness."

128
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.482
There you go, sweetheart.

129
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.318
- Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.
- Don't mention it.

130
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.030
Rupert! Rupert, who are you talking to?

131
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.032
- Mom!
- What is it?

132
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.536
Please stop calling me!

133
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:16.879
It's terrific. It's great.
There's only one problem, though.

134
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:20.382
- He made you bigger.
- Will you give me an answer?

135
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.552
All right, you got the six weeks.
I'll give you the six weeks.

136
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.473
Don't bother me. I'll give you six weeks.
What can I say? Are you happy now?

137
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.600
You're a tough man, Rupe.

138
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.852
You gotta be in this business.

139
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.648
- Hello.
- Hello. It's Masha, Jerry.

140
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.608
- Did you get my note?
- Who is this?

141
00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:23.237
It's Masha. Did you get the note?
I left it on the back seat.

142
00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:26.281
I dropped it there before
they dragged me out of the car.

143
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.952
Those guys really hurt me.
I think that was a bit much. I really do.

144
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.330
- How did you get this number?
- Don't be angry with me, Jerry.

145
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.376
- I said, how did you get this number?
- I didn't know what else to do.

146
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.835
How have you been, Rita?

147
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.756
- Do I know you?
- I think you might.

148
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.888
Rupert.

149
00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.516
- Rupert Pupkin, right?
- Right.

150
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.353
I brought you a little present.

151
00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:43.609
Oh, yeah. I remember. Mr. Romance, heh.

152
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.529
Put an aspirin in that. It'll last longer.

153
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.117
So, what are you up to these days?

154
00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:56.330
You're looking as beautiful as ever, Rita.

155
00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:59.875
Well, here I am.
Local cheerleader makes good.

156
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:04.671
You know, it's funny, but I...
I, uh, voted for you, Most Beautiful.

157
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.925
- Did you? That was sweet.
- I didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but...

158
00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:12.054
Yeah, now you can tell me.
It's okay, we're both adults.

159
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.016
When you're younger,
you're afraid to say those things...

160
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.477
...but when you get older, 15-, 20 years later...

161
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:22.147
...you can say all those things
that you should have said 15-, 20 years ago.

162
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:26.193
Isn't that the final irony of life? Isn't it?

163
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.904
I guess.

164
00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.284
Are you happy in this place, Rita?

165
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.413
- Why? You got something better?
- Maybe.

166
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.792
- Oh, really? Like what?
- Well, what are you doing tonight?

167
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.753
- What am I doing tonight?
- Yeah. What's so funny?

168
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.217
It only took you 15 years to ask me for a date.
Don't you think it's a little late?

169
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:54.930
Really? Well...

170
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.767
Waiter? Can I have a fresh one?

171
00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.061
Rita.

172
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.938
Who is your favorite movie star?

173
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:08.819
This some kind of a game? You gonna tell me
something about my character, my future?

174
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:13.824
You'll see. Tell me.
Everybody has a favorite movie star.

175
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:16.993
Well, I better come up with somebody
or we'll never get out of here, right?

176
00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:22.666
- That's a little test, heh.
- Let's see. Marilyn Monroe.

177
00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.170
Perfect.

178
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.389
Talent register, huh?

179
00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:42.978
That's her name.

180
00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:46.982
She signed this when she was in New York
on her publicity tour for The Misfits.

181
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.317
- That was her last movie, you know.
- Yeah?

182
00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:54.823
She wasn't a great actress,
but she did have a real gift for comedy.

183
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.035
She died tragically alone, like many
of the world's most beautiful women.

184
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.955
I don't wanna see that happening to you.

185
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.337
- Who's this?
- Burt Reynolds.

186
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.465
- This?
- Mel Brooks.

187
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:15.510
He's what you call "on" funny.
Others are just regular.

188
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:19.514
That's Sid Caesar. He's remarkable.
I really like him. He's great.

189
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:22.267
Woody Allen. He's a personal friend of mine.

190
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.771
- Of course he is.
- Ha, ha. No, he is.

191
00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.816
That's Ernie Kovacs. He was wonderful.

192
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:34.279
He was a great comedian, a great
innovator, and it was a great, great loss.

193
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.573
Oh, I bet some of these are worth money.

194
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:40.535
Oh, yeah. Especially this one. Just hold it.

195
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.085
- Who's this?
- Well, just take a guess.

196
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.714
- Heh, it looks like a retard wrote this.
Ha-ha-ha.

197
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.550
The more scribbled the name,
the bigger the fame.

198
00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.429
That might be true, Rupert, but who is it?

199
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.057
"R" is the first letter.

200
00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:06.144
- Come on, Rupert. Who is it? I'm tired.
- Well, I'll give you a little hint.

201
00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.522
- R?
- Robert Redford.

202
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.316
No.

203
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.236
No, no.

204
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.905
That's Rupert Pupkin.

205
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:21.576
Rupert Pupkin.

206
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.664
I surprised you, didn't I?

207
00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.087
Take this as a gift.

208
00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:38.593
Take good care of that. In a few weeks,
everyone's gonna want one.

209
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.637
Rupert, you have not changed.

210
00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:44.933
Just a couple of hours ago,
do you know who I was talking to? Guess.

211
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.937
- Your shrink?
- Heh, that's very funny.

212
00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.774
No. Jerry Langford.
That's right. The Jerry Langford.

213
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.776
He gave me the go-ahead, Rita.

214
00:19:56.112 --> 00:20:00.615
You know what? Don't tell anyone yet, but
you're looking at the new King of Comedy.

215
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.744
Why not me? Why not?

216
00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.914
A guy can get anything he wants,
as long as he pays the price.

217
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:11.793
What's so funny about that?
I mean, crazier things have happened.

218
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:14.629
You don't understand
what a shot on Langford means.

219
00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:16.882
That's coast-to-coast national TV...

220
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.886
...a bigger audience than the greatest
comedians played to in a whole lifetime.

221
00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.305
A shot at a free ticket on the comedy circuit.

222
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:27.475
A comedy show of my own.
The Rupert Pupkin Show. Everything.

223
00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:30.103
All that leads in one direction: Hollywood.

224
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:33.773
A beach house in Malibu on the ocean.
And we'll keep a suite at the Sherry.

225
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:37.819
Everybody stays there when they make it big.
Up top, so we can look down and yell:

226
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:41.489
"Hey, tough luck, suckers!
Better luck next time."

227
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.491
Come on. What do you say?

228
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.995
It sounds wonderful, Rupert,
and I wish you the best of luck.

229
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.957
But it's getting late and I'm a working girl.
I gotta go home.

230
00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:55.337
I don't get you.
Here I am offering you a way out.

231
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.632
Rita, every king needs a queen.

232
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.134
I want you to be mine.

233
00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.223
This is a nice street. Nice building.

234
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.851
- Thanks for your jacket, Rupert.
- Oh.

235
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.481
I guess you're entitled
to come up and have some coffee.

236
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.233
Oh, no, I wouldn't wanna impose, really.

237
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:19.861
- I know I can be...
- What do you want, Rupert?

238
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:21.529
What?

239
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.993
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

240
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.705
Rita, you still don't understand? I love you.

241
00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:35.001
I wanna help change your life,
if you'll just give me a chance.

242
00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.839
What if I set something up
between me, you and Jerry?

243
00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:42.884
What if we went out to dinner one night?
What do you think?

244
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:47.597
You know what's even better?
We'll go to his summer house for a weekend.

245
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:50.892
- He wouldn't wanna meet me.
- That's not true.

246
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.062
Jerry is a very nice guy.

247
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.774
He's a very, very nice guy,
and we had a terrific meeting.

248
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:02.696
You shouldn't sell yourself short. You have
too little faith, and you're a wonderful person.

249
00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:09.869
Why don't you go to sleep
and get a good night's rest, okay?

250
00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:12.831
Okay.

251
00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.376
- Good night, Rupert.
- Good night.

252
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.713
Go to sleep right away.

253
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.350
I'll tell you, boy.

254
00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:36.104
Hi, Liza. Good seeing you.

255
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:39.899
Jerry, good seeing you. Jerry. Don't get up.

256
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.278
Ah, oh, boy, I'll tell you.

257
00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:45.572
Every time you come back from a tour...

258
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.117
...there must be something in the air
or the tour, it really becomes you.

259
00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:51.953
It's like you become rejuvenated.
I don't know what it is.

260
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:55.081
Isn't that so, everybody? Isn't that so?

261
00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:59.169
Heh, that's the truth. I'll tell you.
It's amazing. You look wonderful.

262
00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:04.132
Yeah, I know. You look wonderful too, Jerry.
I wasn't leaving you out, heh.

263
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.135
What? Yeah!

264
00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:18.104
Oh, Jerry. I love this guy.
Always coming up with these great lines.

265
00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:21.775
I love him. I love him.
He's wonderful. You're wonderful.

266
00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:24.277
I don't know what I'd do without you.

267
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:29.407
Rupert! The bus is here.
It's early. Try to be on time for once!

268
00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:33.828
I can't believe this. Ha, ha, I gotta go now.
Yeah, I gotta catch a bus.

269
00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:38.583
Jerry, take care of yourself.
Baby, be good. Good luck in Rio.

270
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:46.591
- Good morning, Rupert.
- Good morning.

271
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.594
- How are you?
- This is for you.

272
00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:51.221
Work.

273
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:55.600
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00.

274
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:58.937
Is it 10 o'clock?
Could I use the phone for one second?

275
00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:00.146
- Is it local?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:02.941
Sure. Just dial 9 first, and make it short.

277
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:13.535
Hello. Jerry Langford, please.

278
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.870
Rupert Pupkin.

279
00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:17.956
Thank you.

280
00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:23.336
Yes, uh, is Jerry there, please?
Rupert Pupkin.

281
00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:25.380
Yes.

282
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.176
Well, just tell him it's Rupert calling,
and he'll know what it's about. Thank you.

283
00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:35.890
Oh. Oh, he is? Well, that's okay.
I'm in a meeting myself.

284
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:41.187
Uh, just tell him I called. Thank you very much.
And I'll call later. Thank you. Bye.

285
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.857
Was that the Jerry Langford?

286
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:46.985
- I'll see you, Roberta.
- Sure.

287
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:52.782
Hello. Jerry Langford, please.
Rupert Pupkin.

288
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.911
Yes, Rupert Pupkin calling.
Jerry Langford, please.

289
00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:59.664
Which, the first name or the second name?

290
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:05.503
P-U-P-K-l-N. It's often mispronounced
and misspelled, so that's why... Yes.

291
00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:09.924
Jerry knows I'm calling.
He knows what it's about. Sure.

292
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:15.430
I see, I see. I see. Yes, you can call me.

293
00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:17.932
I'll be here for the next hour and a half.

294
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:24.439
I'm at my office, and the number is JL5-4321.

295
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:34.741
I am waiting for a phone call.
It'll only take a few minutes.

296
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:38.119
- All these phones don't work.
- The phone does not work.

297
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.580
I cannot make a call. I am expecting a call.

298
00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:44.459
- Let me try. I'll make a call.
- It doesn't work.

299
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:48.546
Wait. Let me just slide in and make a call.
Let me just make a call.

300
00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:52.967
- It's important.
- This phone don't work either!

301
00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:27.460
I can't do that. Because
we're gonna be working late. Hold on.

302
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:29.462
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, Jerry Langford, please.

303
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.757
- Your name, please?
- Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

304
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:38.179
- Rupert?
- Pupkin. P-U-P-K-l-N.

305
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:41.474
People often misspell it and mispronounce it.

306
00:26:44.103 --> 00:26:49.315
There's a man here by the name of Rupert
Pumpkin who wants to see Mr. Langford.

307
00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:58.825
I'm sorry, Mr. Pumpkin, but Mr. Langford's
secretary has no record of your appointment.

308
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.495
Pardon me?

309
00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:04.706
We have no record of your appointment.

310
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:08.876
Oh, well, technically speaking,
I don't have an official appointment...

311
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:13.006
...but he did ask me to call him personally,
and I was in the neighborhood.

312
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:16.301
I was having trouble calling for some reason.

313
00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:18.219
The line seemed to be busy.

314
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:21.055
He has no appointment.

315
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:24.392
His secretary wants to know
what this is in reference to.

316
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.103
- Mr. Gangemi, go right in.
- Hello?

317
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:32.483
Yes. Jerry and I discussed my being on
the show last night. He told me to call. Yes.

318
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:36.070
No, sure, sure. Sure.

319
00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.823
I'm supposed to wait.

320
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:17.904
Is that cork?

321
00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:20.948
I don't know what it is. Is it dripping on you?

322
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.785
No. I was looking at the patterns.
Uh...

323
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:28.206
You know, cork is good for sound.

324
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.833
It's very quiet in here.

325
00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:33.795
Reception.

326
00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:37.673
No, you got an hour or so
before they come in. Yeah.

327
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:40.009
He hasn't come back from the meeting yet.

328
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.970
- Mr. Pipkin?
- Pupkin.

329
00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:45.640
- Sorry. I'm Cathy Long. Can I help you?
- You are?

330
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:49.310
I'm Bert Thomas's assistant.
He's our executive producer.

331
00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:53.314
Oh, I'm sorry. I've already spoken to Jerry
directly about my being on the show.

332
00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:57.110
He told me to get in touch with him personally.
I'm here to follow up on that.

333
00:28:57.277 --> 00:29:00.321
- What is it exactly that you do?
- I stand-up comic.

334
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:04.158
- Oh. Where are you working now?
- Right now I'm working on new material.

335
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:08.162
Well, as soon as you do start working again,
why don't you give us a call...

336
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.915
...and we'll send someone
to check out your act. Thanks.

337
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:14.335
- Jerry and I went over this last night.
- Does Jerry know your work?

338
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:17.255
Yes. I don't think he does.

339
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:22.009
- Do you have a tape I could listen to?
- A tape? Oh, naturally. Whatever you'd like.

340
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:26.556
- Why don't you drop me by a tape?
- I will. I can see where Jerry would need that.

341
00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:30.435
- Of course. Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

342
00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:33.062
This is really what's right.

343
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.314
This is great. This is...

344
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:39.360
See you again. Nice talking to you. Bye.

345
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.788
Rupert. Hey, Rupert.

346
00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:55.376
I gotta talk to you.
What happened last night in the car?

347
00:29:55.544 --> 00:29:58.004
- Did he talk about me?
- No, he didn't.

348
00:29:58.172 --> 00:30:02.216
- He talked about me, as a matter of fact.
- He must've said something about me.

349
00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:05.678
What's he gonna say about you
after what you did in the car last night?

350
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:10.266
- You must be really loving this.
- You were schmucko supremo last night.

351
00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:14.729
Hold on a minute. I'm the schmuck? Me?
You're wrong, buddy. You're very wrong.

352
00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:19.692
If I hadn't gotten in that car, you'd never
even have had the chance to talk to Jerry.

353
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.779
What? I don't wanna be cruel,
but we're in front of Jerry's building.

354
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:27.783
God forbid he should see me with you.
Jerry and I have a real relationship.

355
00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:33.039
No fantasy world. After what you did last night,
I don't even wanna see you anymore.

356
00:30:33.207 --> 00:30:37.919
Fine! That's the way you want it?
See if I care! Just get it to him.

357
00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:43.049
I'm not giving him anything. No way. You're
the one who's so friendly. You give it to him.

358
00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:46.677
We're having a communication problem,
and I need you to get this to him.

359
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:50.848
Is that what you call it? You're always bragging
about how you broke bread with Jerry.

360
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:54.268
Just do this for me, Rupert.
I've done things for you.

361
00:30:54.436 --> 00:30:57.605
You haven't done anything for me.
What are you talking about?

362
00:30:57.773 --> 00:31:02.026
How about Howard Johnson's? I bought you
food. I bought you coffee night after night.

363
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:05.029
You got your mind screwed up.
I bought my own coffee.

364
00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:07.615
You never bought anything!

365
00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:10.618
What about things I did for you
that no money can buy?

366
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:16.290
What about the time I gave you my spot?
I let you get right next to Jerry!

367
00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:21.671
I waited for eight hours and you went right
next to him because you were crying to me!

368
00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:26.634
And what about the time I gave you my last
album of The Best of Jerry? What about that?

369
00:31:26.802 --> 00:31:29.679
I didn't even ask you for money,
and I can't even pay my rent!

370
00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:33.516
What are you talking about? I live in a hovel!
And you live in a townhouse!

371
00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:35.643
I can't believe this girl!

372
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:37.562
Here, I got money for you.

373
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:43.484
I can't believe how long I've been your friend
and listened to your tired, stale, boring jokes!

374
00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:45.820
- Here's $900.
- Will you be quiet?

375
00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:48.322
Take this and give it to Jerry.

376
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.367
All right, this is the last time.
This is the last time.

377
00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:54.328
- When are you gonna get it to him?
- You're a wacko.

378
00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:58.374
You make sure. I'll know if you don't.
I know where you are, where Jerry is!

379
00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:00.459
I cover the waterfront! Remember that!

380
00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:05.464
What are you looking at? Beat it!
You scum! You're street trash!

381
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:25.693
First, Miss Long, thank you for your help
at the office and for passing this on to Jerry.

382
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.154
I appreciate it more than you know.

383
00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:33.868
Jerry, thank you for listening to this material
and for the opportunity you've given me.

384
00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:37.330
Lots of people think that guys like you,
people who've made it...

385
00:32:37.497 --> 00:32:40.666
...lose their feeling for struggling
young talent such as myself.

386
00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:44.211
But now I know from experience
that those people are just cynics...

387
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.505
...embittered by their own failure.

388
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:51.552
I know, Jerry, that you are as human
as the rest of us, if not more so.

389
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.430
No point in going on about it.
You know how I feel.

390
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:58.267
So let's get on with the show,
The Best of Rupert Pupkin.

391
00:32:58.435 --> 00:33:02.772
Jerry, I've sketched out this little outline
in order to save you a bit of time.

392
00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:08.235
It's a little introduction. So close your eyes
and imagine it's exactly 6:00.

393
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:14.075
You're standing in the wings, and we hear
the orchestra strike up your theme song.

394
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:20.247
And now from
New York, it's The Jerry Langford Show...

395
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:24.919
...with Jerry's guests:
Richard Pryor, Ben Gazzara...

396
00:33:25.087 --> 00:33:27.922
...Elizabeth Ashley, Carol Burnett...

397
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.759
And the comedy find of the year,
making his television debut...

398
00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:36.430
- ...Rupert Pupkin, the new King of Comedy!
- Rupert! Rupert!

399
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.933
Are you crazy? What's the matter with you?

400
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:42.603
- Come on, Mom!
- People are sleeping. Lower it!

401
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.984
- What's the matter with you?
- Mom!

402
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:53.197
- Take it easy. Lower it.
- I'm not gonna lower it! I have to do this now!

403
00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:56.450
I don't mind you playing it, but lower it.

404
00:33:59.413 --> 00:34:01.622
Now, you come on, Jerry,
and do your monologue.

405
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.627
When the time comes, this is how I see you
introducing me. Something like this:

406
00:34:06.795 --> 00:34:11.757
"Will you please give your warmest welcome
to the newest King of Comedy...

407
00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:14.176
...Rupert Pupkin!"

408
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:22.101
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

409
00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:24.687
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey...

410
00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:31.110
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

411
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:38.743
But the fact is that no one's allowed to be...

412
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.663
Because once you fall
below a certain level...

413
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.902
- Mr. Pipkin.
- Pupkin.

414
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:16.071
- Pupkin. Sorry.
- You'll get it right one of these days.

415
00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.991
- I'll bet you have a tape for me.
- Right here.

416
00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:22.870
Got your name on it? We'll listen to it
and get it back to you as soon as we can.

417
00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:27.208
Thank you very much. When Jerry
finds a moment. Good. When will that be?

418
00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.376
Uh...

419
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:34.340
Actually, you can try me tomorrow. We might
know something by then. Otherwise, Monday.

420
00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:36.342
Monday?

421
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:41.222
Hmm. Miss Long, what I might do is just wait
here a while. Maybe Jerry'll find a minute.

422
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:45.309
You're wasting your time.
We won't know until tomorrow at the earliest.

423
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:49.230
That's all right. I don't mind.
I'm not wasting my time. I'm glad to do it.

424
00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:51.941
It's important to me, so I really don't mind.

425
00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:54.819
- It'll probably be Monday.
- Monday?

426
00:35:57.364 --> 00:35:59.573
Well, I'll still wait.

427
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:02.243
Really, I don't mind. It's okay.

428
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:06.080
I'll tell you what. Why don't you try me
tomorrow afternoon for sure?

429
00:36:06.248 --> 00:36:08.958
- Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Mm-hm.

430
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.127
- Four thirty.
- Four thirty. I'll be here. Thank you.

431
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:13.838
- You're welcome.
- And thank Jerry.

432
00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.673
- I will.
- Okay.

433
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:22.263
Goodbye.

434
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:28.227
Goodbye.

435
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:34.608
At least once in his life
every man is a genius.

436
00:36:34.776 --> 00:36:37.945
And, Rupe, it's gonna be
more than once in your life for you.

437
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:40.865
It's gonna be a number of times,
because you've got it.

438
00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:44.618
From what I've heard here,
you've got it and you're stuck with it.

439
00:36:44.786 --> 00:36:49.373
I don't care if you wanted to get rid of it,
you couldn't. It's always gonna be there.

440
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:54.503
Now, I know there's no formula for it.
I just don't know how you do it.

441
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:58.799
And I'm not curious, mind you,
because I wanna use the material.

442
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:04.805
I'm just curious to know how you do it.
I really have to ask you. How do you do it?

443
00:37:04.973 --> 00:37:10.644
I think it's that I look at my whole life,
and I see the awful, terrible things in my life...

444
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:13.939
...and turn it into something funny.

445
00:37:14.107 --> 00:37:16.483
It just happens.

446
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:19.194
Were the first few one-liners strong enough?

447
00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:25.451
If they were any stronger, you'd hurt yourself.
They're marvelous. Leave them alone.

448
00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:29.163
I remember a man... A man said...
Listen to me. Listen to me.

449
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:33.584
A man said something very profound
some years ago, which I later originated.

450
00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:39.006
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
You wanna know how I know it's so good?

451
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:43.928
- Yes.
- Because I envy you. I hate you, but I envy you.

452
00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:48.098
Because it's purity, it's marvelous,
it's humor based on you.

453
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:52.811
No one else could do it but you.
I wouldn't lie. I wouldn't lie to you, Rupe.

454
00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:58.359
Now, look, this weekend would be a perfect
time for you to come out to the house...

455
00:37:58.526 --> 00:38:02.529
...if you care to, and we can hash it around.
Only because I wanna know how you do it.

456
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.990
There'll be people there,
but we can still work.

457
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:07.701
- It sounds great.
- Terrific.

458
00:38:07.869 --> 00:38:09.995
- I would really like to come.
- Wonderful.

459
00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:12.331
Could I bring somebody?

460
00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:16.335
- A young lady?
- A very special young lady.

461
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.712
Of course. I'd like to meet her.

462
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:25.886
- Heh, hey, Jerry, how you doing?
- How are you?

463
00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:28.973
- You're looking good.
- You should see me in my white taffeta.

464
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:34.561
- You're doing some great shows, Jerry.
- Thanks a lot.

465
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:39.358
- How about putting me on your show?
- Yeah. I could've used you last night.

466
00:38:53.623 --> 00:38:55.708
Come on down!

467
00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:02.047
- Hi, Jerry. How are you?
- Hi there.

468
00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:05.259
Morris, you will not believe
who's coming down here.

469
00:39:05.427 --> 00:39:08.637
Jerry Langford, right?
Morris, please hold on.

470
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:12.224
Jerry, could you please
sign my magazine for me?

471
00:39:12.392 --> 00:39:16.228
You're just wonderful.
I've watched you your entire career.

472
00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:21.734
Would you say something to my nephew
Morris on the phone? He's in the hospital.

473
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:25.904
- I'm sorry. I'm late.
- I hope you get cancer!

474
00:39:26.072 --> 00:39:28.073
Jerry?

475
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:30.367
I can't. I'm late.

476
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:37.184
Yes, sir? Oh, hi.

477
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:39.603
- Hi. How are you?
- Not bad.

478
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:42.356
Good, good. I'm fine.

479
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:47.194
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like to see Jerry, please.

480
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:49.363
You are?

481
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:51.657
Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin.

482
00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:56.745
Mr. Potkin is here. That's right.

483
00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:58.914
Okay.

484
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:01.208
She'll be with you in a minute.

485
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.377
- Who's that?
- Miss Long.

486
00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:07.881
Oh, well, I'd prefer to see Jerry.

487
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:10.134
Miss Long will take care of you.

488
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.553
Okay. I'll wait right here.

489
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:22.771
And as a surprise to Rupert
for being on the show with us tonight...

490
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:27.526
...we'd like to present to you someone
in a form that we've never presented before.

491
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:32.072
A mystery guest. Would you please welcome
our mystery guest? Let's hear it for him.

492
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:45.169
Jerry, this is the mystery guest?

493
00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.087
This is the mystery guest.

494
00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:50.215
Let me see if I can place him.
I think I know.

495
00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:53.093
- Don't you remember me?
- No, I don't.

496
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:56.930
- I'm George Kapp.
- George Kapp. My high-school principal!

497
00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:59.600
- You guessed it.
- Well, how are you?

498
00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:02.811
You used to fail me. What do you have him
on the show for? He's an enemy, heh.

499
00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:05.981
- Only because you deserved it.
- Oh, thank you.

500
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:08.317
But I'm a justice of the peace now.

501
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:10.944
- I perform weddings.
- Do you?

502
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.822
Jerry.

503
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:18.994
Jerry, what are you doing?
I can't believe this.

504
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:21.205
Believe it. It's part of the surprise.

505
00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:25.792
How would the audience like to see the King
of Comedy marry his queen on the show?

506
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.712
I can't believe it. I don't know what to say!

507
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.465
He's too much. He's too much.

508
00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:48.667
Dearly beloved, when Rupert here
was a student at Clifton High School...

509
00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:54.548
...none of us...
Myself, his teachers, his classmates.

510
00:43:54.716 --> 00:43:58.218
- dreamt that he would amount
to a hill of beans.

511
00:43:58.386 --> 00:44:02.180
But we were wrong.
And you, Rupert, you were right.

512
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:08.103
And that's why tonight,
before the entire nation...

513
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:12.399
...we'd like to apologize to you personally...

514
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:15.902
...and to beg your forgiveness for...

515
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.947
For all the things we did to you.

516
00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:22.868
And we'd like to thank you
personally, all of us...

517
00:44:23.036 --> 00:44:28.081
...for the meaning you've given our lives.

518
00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:33.420
Please accept our warmest wishes,
Rita and Rupert...

519
00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:37.966
...for a long and successful reign together.

520
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:44.014
We'll be back to marry them
right after this word.

521
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.435
Mr. Pupkin.

522
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:49.936
- How are you today?
- I'm fine.

523
00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:51.730
Good, good.

524
00:44:51.898 --> 00:44:55.233
I wanna thank you for your tape.
We listened to it with great interest.

525
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:56.610
Oh, good. I'm glad.

526
00:44:56.778 --> 00:44:59.446
We see a lot of good things
in what you're doing.

527
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:04.242
We think you have potential, which is why
I'm gonna be absolutely honest with you.

528
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.162
That's the way you should be.
Absolutely honest.

529
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.123
- We don't think you're ready yet.
- Don't think I'm ready.

530
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:13.502
- We don't feel that you're right for Jerry.
- Right for Jerry. Mm-hm.

531
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:19.257
Some of the material is good, but some of the
one-liners, for instance, are not very strong.

532
00:45:19.425 --> 00:45:23.011
They're not very strong. You didn't
like some of the jokes. Is that it?

533
00:45:23.179 --> 00:45:25.639
- That's right.
- Good. I can take care of that.

534
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:30.143
Just tell me the ones you don't like, and
no problem. Actually, that's a great help. Great.

535
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.606
We think you have a good potential.
Your timing is excellent.

536
00:45:34.774 --> 00:45:36.942
But you should keep developing your act.

537
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:41.613
You ought to test it in a few live situations.
I think that'd be very good for you.

538
00:45:41.781 --> 00:45:44.408
There are a number of clubs that you can try.

539
00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:49.037
When you start working in one of those,
give us a call. We'll send someone down.

540
00:45:49.205 --> 00:45:51.289
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

541
00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:53.166
Thank you.

542
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:58.213
Miss Long, may I ask you a question?
Are you speaking for Jerry?

543
00:45:58.381 --> 00:45:59.673
- Yes, I am.
- You are?

544
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:04.845
- He has complete faith in our judgment.
- Well, I'm sorry to have to say this.

545
00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:08.014
But I have to tell you,
I don't have faith in your judgment.

546
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:12.310
I'm sorry that you feel that way. But I guess
there's nothing we can do about that.

547
00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:15.188
No, I'll have to disagree
with you again, Miss Long.

548
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:17.441
That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.

549
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:20.694
Now, would you excuse me?
I have a great many things to do.

550
00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:23.155
Miss Long, when will Jerry be back?

551
00:46:23.322 --> 00:46:26.491
Mr. Langford won't be in
until very late this afternoon.

552
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:30.162
Mr. Pupkin, we mean what we say
when we thank you for stopping up.

553
00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:34.374
And we mean it when we tell you
that you can call us when you start working.

554
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:37.335
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

555
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.279
Is there anyone else you'd like to see?

556
00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:09.117
No. That's all right.

557
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:13.246
I don't mind waiting.

558
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:18.084
Which reminds me about the man who waited
so long, he forgot what he was waiting for.

559
00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:23.632
Well, would you mind
waiting outside, Mr. Pupnick?

560
00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:26.218
This is a reception area, not a waiting room.

561
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:29.054
I understand.

562
00:47:40.566 --> 00:47:43.443
- Did you ask him to leave?
- Yeah, but he won't go.

563
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:46.071
- What's his name?
- Rupert Pumpkin.

564
00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:52.953
Hi. I'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security
for the Langford organization.

565
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.455
Why don't we go outside and talk?
Is this your bag?

566
00:47:55.623 --> 00:47:57.791
Yes. I'm waiting for Jerry. It's personal.

567
00:47:57.959 --> 00:48:01.294
- We'll talk about that outside.
- I know he's expecting me.

568
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:05.465
Listen, we'll talk about that outside.
Please take your bag.

569
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:08.969
I'll explain company policy
to you on the way, okay?

570
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:13.598
Now, I'm pretty sure you understand
that we have certain rules here...

571
00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:19.104
...that are essential to the smooth functioning
of our operation. Right?

572
00:48:19.272 --> 00:48:22.440
- If I could just say that...
- Now, just listen, please. Okay?

573
00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:26.945
And that without these rules, we really
wouldn't be able to function at our best.

574
00:48:27.113 --> 00:48:29.322
- You follow my point?
- I get the point, except...

575
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.992
- Please, Mr. Puffer.
- After you.

576
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:35.662
- After you, sir, please.
- If I could just say that Jerry is...

577
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.292
Just listen to me. I checked with Miss Long.
You do not have an appointment.

578
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:44.629
Now, company policy
is that only authorized personnel...

579
00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:48.508
...and those persons with official business
with our organization...

580
00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:51.511
...are permitted on our premises.

581
00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:54.347
In other words, you want me
to leave the building?

582
00:49:18.331 --> 00:49:20.915
- Well? Did you get it to him?
- What?

583
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:26.630
- Did you get my letter to him?
- He's not in there, okay?

584
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:30.050
Now that you're so in with him,
you can't do me a favor? Don't bother.

585
00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.677
Just give me the letter.
I'll find somebody else.

586
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.388
- He wasn't there.
- I saw him go in myself.

587
00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:37.557
- Who?
- Jerry!

588
00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:40.852
- He's up there right now. Wanna see him?
- That's impossible.

589
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.562
They assured me that he was out.

590
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.023
- And you believed them?
- Mm-hm.

591
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:48.234
You're so naive.
I would expect that from you.

592
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:50.695
So inexperienced. You're such a chump.

593
00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:54.032
- He went up there just now?
- Of course. Go back up.

594
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.910
Assert yourself a little bit.
He's up there right now.

595
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.131
Oh, no.

596
00:50:10.675 --> 00:50:13.301
- Would you tell Jerry I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

597
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:17.055
- I know he is. Would you tell him I'm here?
- I'm sorry, he's not in.

598
00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:20.809
You're putting your job on the line, lady.
You hear me?

599
00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.769
Security.

600
00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:25.522
You too.

601
00:50:46.585 --> 00:50:48.837
Mr. Pupkin, what are you doing here?

602
00:50:49.672 --> 00:50:51.464
Mr. Pupkin?

603
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.717
Mr. Pupkin.

604
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:56.678
Get security on the telephone.

605
00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:04.728
There he goes.

606
00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:10.275
Hold on. Grab his other arm.
Hold on to him.

607
00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:13.319
Right. All right, right out the door.

608
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:16.781
You wouldn't listen, huh?

609
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:18.158
Jerry? Jerry?

610
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:22.871
- Nobody's gonna help you.
- You're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.

611
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:25.999
- You had your warning, Krupkin.
- My lawyer'll be calling you.

612
00:51:26.167 --> 00:51:28.877
Make sure he gets my name right.

613
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:34.466
- Say goodbye to our guest, Miss Long.
- Wait till Jerry hears about this.

614
00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:37.010
I will mention your name to Jerry, Pupper.

615
00:51:37.178 --> 00:51:43.099
Listen good, because if we see
your face again, we're gonna call the police.

616
00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:48.021
Thank you. Thank you very much, heh, heh.

617
00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:51.274
Terrific. I suppose
that you got the letter to him?

618
00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:53.568
- No, but I'll get it later.
- Great.

619
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:57.489
- You just got thrown out of the building.
- I didn't get thrown out.

620
00:51:57.656 --> 00:51:59.365
- What do you call that?
- I didn't.

621
00:51:59.533 --> 00:52:01.993
Excuse me.
I wasn't thrown out of the building.

622
00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:05.705
- You're a constant embarrassment.
- They walked me outside.

623
00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:10.335
- You can't handle the simplest things.
- I'll tell you something else. I'm going...

624
00:52:10.503 --> 00:52:14.130
- Jerry invited me for the weekend.
- Great. I'll go with you.

625
00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:18.009
Do I look okay?

626
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:20.386
- Wonderful.
- Does this look all right?

627
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:22.806
- That, I'm not sure about.
- What do you mean?

628
00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.391
- You look wonderful.
- What's wrong with it?

629
00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:27.560
Nothing. I just don't think you need it.

630
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:31.189
- You don't think it looks nice on me?
- No, it looks wonderful.

631
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:49.582
Hello.

632
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.960
- You must be Jonno.
- Uh, yes.

633
00:52:52.127 --> 00:52:54.420
My name is Rupert Pupkin
and this is Rita Keane.

634
00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:57.966
- Would you let Jerry know we're here?
- Mr. Langford asked you to come?

635
00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:00.593
No, we just thought we'd drop in
uninvited for the weekend.

636
00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:06.432
Come on in. We'll be staying
in separate rooms. The blue bag is mine.

637
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.562
- But Mr. Langford's not here.
- Where is he? Out playing golf?

638
00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.146
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

639
00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:15.650
- I hope he's finally gonna break 100.
- A hundred?

640
00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:19.070
- Perhaps better you come back.
- No, we'll just wait.

641
00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:23.491
- But Mr. Langford is not here.
- That's okay. We'll just wait.

642
00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:25.910
That's okay. We don't mind waiting.

643
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:28.121
Isn't this lovely?

644
00:53:31.584 --> 00:53:34.085
Table's only set for one.

645
00:53:40.259 --> 00:53:42.802
- How do you like it?
- I could live here.

646
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.805
Mr. Langford, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

647
00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:49.642
Uh, what's wrong? Everything's wrong.
There are a couple over here.

648
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:55.148
His name is Pumpkin. Pumpkin, yes.
Do you know a name Pumpkin?

649
00:53:58.444 --> 00:54:00.820
Didn't you tell him what time we'd get here?

650
00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:04.157
We didn't have time to iron out the details.
We're the first guests.

651
00:54:04.325 --> 00:54:06.659
But that butler wasn't even expecting us.

652
00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:10.830
Jerry does have more important things
to think about than what to tell his houseboy.

653
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:13.499
Really? Well, excuse me.

654
00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:22.216
He knows everything.
He knew you were playing golf and everything.

655
00:54:22.384 --> 00:54:26.721
Uh, I don't know what he want. He wanna
spend the weekend over here. Yes.

656
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:31.434
And you better come back. He's touching
everything. He's ruining the house.

657
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.519
And I'm getting a heart attack already.

658
00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:38.358
Here's a famous one with the youngest clown
in the world, Zippo. Clown for a day.

659
00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:41.694
Remember this one
with Ray Charles on Jerry's special?

660
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.863
- That's famous.
- I know. There it is.

661
00:54:44.031 --> 00:54:46.824
Here's a famous one
when he was a kid, 12 years old.

662
00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:51.371
Someone sent this in as a part of the show,
"I Knew You When" section.

663
00:54:51.538 --> 00:54:56.209
They thought they were playing a joke.
Now Jerry shows it to everyone on the show.

664
00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:02.048
If I should take a notion...

665
00:55:02.216 --> 00:55:05.218
Let's get a little life into this place.
It's like a funeral parlor.

666
00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:07.553
Jump off into the ocean

667
00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:11.724
You should really turn that off.
You shouldn't put that on. It's not polite.

668
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:15.395
- How about a little spin, handsome?
- We shouldn't be dancing.

669
00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:18.898
- A little fun never hurt anybody.
- What if Jerry walks in?

670
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.985
He'll be happy to see us having a good time.

671
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:26.072
- What if he walks in?
- So? You're his friend. He won't mind.

672
00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:30.743
Ain't nobody's business if I do

673
00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:34.247
Oh, one day...

674
00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:39.585
- I wonder what the rest of this place is like.
- Well, I'm sure it's very nice.

675
00:55:40.421 --> 00:55:42.797
No, Rita, I wouldn't go up there.

676
00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:44.590
- Rita? Rita?
- Come on.

677
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.801
I don't think it's a good idea.

678
00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:52.306
Rita, they're watching us. Rita, I don't think
you have the right to go upstairs.

679
00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:54.267
Rita, please don't go up there.

680
00:56:03.652 --> 00:56:07.655
Would you open the goddamn door?
I was standing out there eight minutes.

681
00:56:07.823 --> 00:56:11.159
What was with the door? Jesus!
Where are they?

682
00:56:11.326 --> 00:56:13.786
I was gonna call the police,
but I wait for you.

683
00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:19.751
Hi, Jerry. Hi, Jerry. How are you?
We were just freshening up upstairs.

684
00:56:19.918 --> 00:56:24.839
Rita, I want you to meet the Jerry Langford.
Jerry, I want you to meet the Rita Keane.

685
00:56:25.007 --> 00:56:28.760
Come on down. Don't be ashamed.
Attagirl. Come on down.

686
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.971
What's your pleasure, Jerry?

687
00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:40.563
It's hot out there. I wanna get something nice
to drink. Jerry, what would you like? Jer?

688
00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:44.275
Jer?

689
00:56:45.569 --> 00:56:50.156
Excuse us, but it's not every day
that a girl like Rita meets a man like you.

690
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:53.576
I mean, this is part of your success.
You have to live with it.

691
00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:56.996
How was your golf game? Was it good?
Did you finally break 100?

692
00:56:57.164 --> 00:57:00.333
- I told them you were not here.
- That's right, he did.

693
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:02.877
Yes, they did. They were really very helpful.

694
00:57:03.045 --> 00:57:06.964
We took an earlier train.
There wasn't anything else until after 1, so...

695
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:12.178
Anyway, I brought the work. It's right here.
All ready. All ready and set to go.

696
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:13.971
So...

697
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.225
...where is everybody?

698
00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:22.188
- What everybody?
- Heh, what everybody? The guests, Jer.

699
00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:25.108
To tell you the truth,
we're getting a little hungry.

700
00:57:25.526 --> 00:57:27.527
You know I could have
the both of you arrested?

701
00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:32.115
He could have us arrested.
Of course you could have us arrested.

702
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.492
There's no way
we can prove that we belong here.

703
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.995
He's great. When he comes up
with an idea, he's terrific.

704
00:57:38.163 --> 00:57:41.415
- Really, I never thought of that.
- You should have.

705
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:45.962
We can set up a story where you invite all
your friends out and you throw them all in jail!

706
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.552
That's terrific. That's terrific.

707
00:57:54.346 --> 00:57:58.558
What's the matter? Lighten up. Let's get
to work on that. After this, of course.

708
00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:00.560
How did you get here?

709
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.896
We walked in the door. What do you mean?
What's the matter with you?

710
00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:05.857
How did you get here?

711
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:09.193
I think you're upset.
I'm gonna leave my material here.

712
00:58:09.361 --> 00:58:12.738
We'll talk later. You've got more
important things to worry about.

713
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:18.077
- We'll just stroll around, wait till lunchtime.
- Did anyone ever tell you you're a moron?

714
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:21.622
You know, Jerry,
I wanna tell you something.

715
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.792
Ordinarily I wouldn't allow anybody
to speak that way about Rita.

716
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.754
But since it's you, I know you're only kidding.
He's a real character.

717
00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:33.676
- Rupert, he's saying he wants us to go.
- No, he's not saying that.

718
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:37.555
Jerry, tell her that. You're not saying that.
He's not saying that at all.

719
00:58:37.723 --> 00:58:40.892
- Call the station, Jonno.
- Where are you going? Rita?

720
00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:44.896
There'll be a cab here in five or 10 minutes.
Wait at the gate and use it.

721
00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:47.440
Why? You going someplace, heh?

722
00:58:47.983 --> 00:58:49.442
No, you are.

723
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:56.282
Did I say something wrong, Jerry? Because
if I did, could we chalk it up to inexperience?

724
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.117
Rita?

725
00:58:59.286 --> 00:59:02.455
I have my stuff right here.
We could do it in a half an hour.

726
00:59:02.623 --> 00:59:05.333
Then you'd have
the rest of the afternoon to yourself.

727
00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:10.838
I want you out of here. I want you
out of here now. Is that plain enough?

728
00:59:11.006 --> 00:59:12.506
- I understand.
- Is that clear?

729
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:16.344
Yeah, yeah. I understand.
Look, you're tired. That's okay.

730
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:20.264
I'm gonna leave the stuff here.
Read it and let me know what you think.

731
00:59:20.432 --> 00:59:23.726
Don't be so dopey. Use your ears.
The man is telling us to go.

732
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:25.811
He is not telling us to go.
Will you stop?

733
00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:29.649
- Mr. Langford, I knew nothing about this.
- Tell her she's wrong, Jerry.

734
00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:33.778
I don't even know him. I haven't seen him
in years. He told me you were friends.

735
00:59:33.946 --> 00:59:35.154
Rita!

736
00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:38.950
I feel terrible. I'm so humiliated.
If there's anything I can do...

737
00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:42.036
Don't listen. She works in a bar.
She wants to spoil everything.

738
00:59:42.204 --> 00:59:44.497
Come on, Rupert. Let's go.

739
00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:49.168
- Jerry...
- Okay, come on. Come on, come on.

740
00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:51.504
- Let's go.
- Sorry, Mr. Langford.

741
00:59:51.672 --> 00:59:55.800
- Here you are. Take your things and go!
- All right, I can take a hint, Jerry.

742
00:59:55.968 --> 00:59:59.845
I just want you to listen to my stuff
for 15 minutes. Is that asking too much?

743
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.265
Yes, it is. I have a life, okay?

744
01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.476
- I have a life too.
- That's not my responsibility.

745
01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:10.189
- It is when you tell me to call you.
- I told you to call to get rid of you!

746
01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.192
- To get rid of me? Okay, I can take a hint.
- That's right.

747
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.779
If I didn't tell you that, we'd still be
on the steps at my apartment!

748
01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.782
- All right, so I made a mistake.
- So did Hitler!

749
01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.703
All right.
This is the way it is when you're famous.

750
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.539
- You understand?
- Now I see. That's how you guys are, huh?

751
01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.542
- Not them. Me. Yeah!
- That's how you are.

752
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.712
- When you reach the top.
- No, I was that way before.

753
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:35.673
- Now I know how people like you are.
- Goodbye and good luck!

754
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:37.383
Goodbye.

755
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.721
And, Jerry. Jerry,
I just wanna say one more thing, Jerry.

756
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:46.892
I'm glad what you did to me today.
Because now I know I can't rely on anybody.

757
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.604
Not you, not anybody.
And I shouldn't rely on anybody.

758
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:55.067
And you wanna know something else?
I'm gonna work 50 times harder...

759
01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.695
...and I'm gonna be 50 times
more famous than you.

760
01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.531
Then you're gonna have idiots like you
plaguing your life!

761
01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:04.869
That's right. Yes. Come on, Rita.
We're wasting our time. Goodbye, Jerry.

762
01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.914
Jonno, lock that door.

763
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.960
- You did good, Mr. Langford.
- Thank you.

764
01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:25.097
It looks real.

765
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.224
That's the whole point.

766
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.066
- Is that him?
- No.

767
01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.444
- You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure. It looks too much like him.

768
01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:42.573
- What do you mean?
- When it's him, it doesn't look like him.

769
01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.245
God, it feels like it's taking him forever.

770
01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.625
How much longer?

771
01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:57.546
It's him.

772
01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.885
Yeah, that's him.

773
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.266
- Don't go too fast.
- Okay, okay.

774
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.811
Stay on this side so you're not all over him.

775
01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:15.648
- I'm getting over as soon as I can.
- Get in the next lane.

776
01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:17.900
Okay, okay, okay.

777
01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:22.947
- Not yet. There are too many people.
- I know. I'll keep going.

778
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:27.201
He walks in the most crowded areas.
You'd think he'd wanna stay away.

779
01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.787
Well, because he doesn't wanna be alone.

780
01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:34.083
Why? Tell me why. I know. You tell me why.

781
01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.838
Don't get an attitude with me.

782
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:42.049
Explain it to me,
because you know so much about him.

783
01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:44.510
Fill me in. Let me learn from you.

784
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:49.348
All right. Because when he walks
on crowded streets, he feels safe, that's why.

785
01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.643
Is that what it is? Thanks for telling me.

786
01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.529
Okay, go past him and stop.

787
01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:11.495
Okay, Jerry. Get over. Get in there.
I'm not fooling around.

788
01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.875
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Get in, Jerry. Get in.

789
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.377
Hi, Jerry.

790
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.593
Take that.
She's gonna hold a gun on your head.

791
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.846
Don't make any false moves.
I'd hate to do anything drastic.

792
01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:34.143
Now, if everything works out, you should be
out of here by the very latest 12-, 12:30.

793
01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.564
Well, maybe 1 -, 1:15 at the very latest.

794
01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:42.026
What I want you to do is call your producer.

795
01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:44.904
- Call what?
- Bert Thomas. I want you to call him.

796
01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.865
I'm gonna give you a phone right now.

797
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:52.161
Get him on the phone,
and I'll tell you exactly what to say, okay?

798
01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.417
Now, if you don't do it,
I don't know what to say.

799
01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.086
There could be a problem.

800
01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:07.635
Watch your eyes, Jerry. I'm gonna take
these off now. It's a little bright in here, okay?

801
01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:24.527
Okay.

802
01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.116
Are these yours?

803
01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:34.703
- Jerry, these are yours?
- Yeah.

804
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:38.916
- Do you mind if I have one?
- I don't mind.

805
01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.125
Thank you.

806
01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:43.045
- Masha, do you want one?
- Save it for me.

807
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.756
- You want one?
- I'd love one, but will you save it?

808
01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:49.426
It's a little bit inconvenient at the moment.
Thank you, Rupert.

809
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.304
- Do you want one?
- No.

810
01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.974
I'll just take one for later then.

811
01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.772
There's no reason to get mad.
I'm just trying to ease the tension.

812
01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.983
Even though this is a strange situation...

813
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.070
...there are moments of friendship
and moments of sharing or whatever.

814
01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.281
Okay, let's go.

815
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:15.911
Jerry, I mean business.

816
01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.999
Get on the phone.
Let's go. The fun is over.

817
01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:24.878
Let's go. Come on.

818
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:44.607
Bert Thomas, please. Jerry Langford.

819
01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.821
- What happened?
- They hung up.

820
01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.369
Call them again. Why did they hang up?

821
01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:00.581
Probably thought it was a gag.
We get that all the time.

822
01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:03.208
Well, I find that strange, you know.

823
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:08.339
But it's typical.
Because that's the way they treat even you.

824
01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.841
Because I'll let you in on a little secret.

825
01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:13.927
That's the way they treated me.

826
01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:16.138
And now look where we are.

827
01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.559
Bert Thomas.

828
01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:24.229
Audrey, this is Jerry Langford.
Get Bert Thomas on the phone, and quickly.

829
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.399
Martino, I know it's you.
I'm too busy for games today.

830
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.819
Did you hear what I said?
This is Jerry Langford. Now, get Bert Thomas.

831
01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.782
I'm not kidding.
It's not a gag. It's serious. Now, move it!

832
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.662
- Why don't we have somebody else?
- Like what?

833
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.164
It's Mr. Langford. He says it's urgent.

834
01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.084
Tell him I'll call him back. I'm busy.

835
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.587
- It's that Martino kid, the impressionist.
- He's a pain in the neck.

836
01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:51.882
Will you do what I tell you? And do it quick.

837
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:56.261
I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas, he insists on
talking to you. I cannot get rid of him.

838
01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.430
Okay, I'll take it.

839
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.060
Martino, you know better...

840
01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:08.273
Bert, I said this is Jerry. Jerry Langford.
And I'm in deep trouble.

841
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:12.945
- Now you'd best pay attention.
- Yeah, I am listening, uh...

842
01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:17.616
Would you give me that again?

843
01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:25.082
Now, wait a minute.
Uh, I wanna ask you something.

844
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.752
What do we call our second cameraman?

845
01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:33.507
We call our second cameraman Helen Keller.

846
01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.802
His favorite color is plaid.

847
01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.638
Helen Keller? Plaid? What is that?

848
01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.307
When someone does
an impression of me on the phone...

849
01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:46.145
...the only way they're gonna know
it's really me is by that clue.

850
01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.773
If I didn't know what we called him,
then he would know it's not me.

851
01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.316
Say no more. I understand.

852
01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:55.154
Now, listen, Bert. Listen carefully.

853
01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.323
"I have a gun...

854
01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.328
...at my head.

855
01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.834
If a man who identifies himself as...

856
01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.674
...the King..."

857
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.680
Card's upside down.

858
01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:24.683
Sorry.

859
01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:30.481
"...is not allowed to be the first guest on..."

860
01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.030
You got a blank card there.

861
01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:42.534
Hold on, Bert. I'm reading from cue cards.

862
01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:49.792
"...tonight's show...

863
01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:55.297
...you will never see me..."

864
01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.551
Go back.

865
01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:03.013
"...alive again."

866
01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:09.394
It's not grammatically correct,
but I think you have the idea.

867
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:13.899
It's clear, but let me break in for a minute.
Let me talk to you. Don't do anything silly.

868
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:16.735
Okay. I'm okay.

869
01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:19.571
I'm okay, Bert. Just get it done.

870
01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.370
He wants you to call at 5:00.
I have the private number.

871
01:09:26.538 --> 01:09:30.499
- They'll do whatever you want.
- Okay, that was very good, Jerry.

872
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.126
Turn around, let's see how it looks.

873
01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:37.923
Oh, I love it. I'm sorry.
The sleeves aren't quite right.

874
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.009
Do you like it on him? What do you think?

875
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.929
I think it looks pretty good.

876
01:09:44.097 --> 01:09:48.100
To guess on it and have it turn out like this,
I'm very pleased with it.

877
01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.645
The color's great, and I like to see him
more casual for a change.

878
01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:56.608
This is a look I like to see on him.
Not so uptight, not so...

879
01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.444
- Okay. I gotta get started here.
- What do you think?

880
01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.155
- It's wonderful. It's very good.
- Be honest with me.

881
01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:05.117
- I'm being honest.
- Would you wear it?

882
01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:10.289
I like it. I'm so glad I went with red.
It looks so good on him.

883
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.166
- It looks good, Jerry.
- Gorgeous. Mm.

884
01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.626
- Come on.
- What?

885
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.421
- Take it off and let's go.
- Oh, okay.

886
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:23.093
You want me to take it off?
Why can't he wear it for a little while?

887
01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.304
Will you take it off, please?

888
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:30.100
I know he's in a meeting, but this is
an emergency and I gotta talk to him.

889
01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:34.646
You'll interrupt him,
or I'm gonna come busting into that meeting.

890
01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.150
No. Forget calling me back. I'm on my way.

891
01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.155
Why didn't you listen to the tape when
I asked you to? It wasn't that hard, was it?

892
01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:47.326
A few minutes of your time to listen to
something that I worked on my whole life.

893
01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:52.497
If that's what's behind all this, let's go to
my office and we'll play the tape right now.

894
01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:56.043
Are you crazy? You know what would
happen to me if I went there now?

895
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.296
- I'm not stupid.
- Nobody's calling you stupid.

896
01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.506
You pulled this off. That makes you smart.

897
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.843
You know, Jerry,
I'm gonna tell you something.

898
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.970
Friendship is a two-way street.

899
01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:12.184
You know that?
And you couldn't have cared less about me.

900
01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:16.188
Am I gonna hold this till next Shavuoth?
You gonna make some decisions here?

901
01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:19.650
You gonna knock off
the talking for two minutes?

902
01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.069
When you put the sweater on,
was I bothering you, huh?

903
01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.446
It took one minute.
You have a long night ahead.

904
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.574
- I have something to say.
- You've got more than enough to say.

905
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:32.996
You're driving me nuts. Can you be quiet
for one goddamn minute and let me rest?

906
01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.375
With this gun? You're driving me crazy!

907
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:39.211
You have not shut up
since we walked into my house.

908
01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:41.546
This is my house. This is my domain.

909
01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:45.342
Jerry is my guest and you're my guest,
and you're lucky to be here!

910
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.346
You get to change in my house, you get
your head together for the show tonight.

911
01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:53.058
Why don't you give me a little break?
Why can't you give me a break? Shut up!

912
01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:57.229
You shut up. I did give you a break.
I listened to you talk about that sweater.

913
01:11:57.397 --> 01:12:01.066
Worrying about the sleeves, the color.
Did I say anything?

914
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.236
I didn't make it for you. I made it for Jerry.
It looks fabulous.

915
01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:08.615
Whose idea was this anyway? If it wasn't
for me, you wouldn't even be here.

916
01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:13.578
Why didn't you listen to the tape
when I asked you to? Was that so hard to do?

917
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:19.251
I'm sure you can understand, doing the kind
of show I'm doing, it's mind-boggling.

918
01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:22.921
There's so much stuff that comes down,
you can't keep your head clear.

919
01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.924
And if that's the case, I'm wrong.

920
01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.927
You're right, I'm wrong.
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

921
01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:34.433
I'm just a human being,
with all of the foibles and all of the traps.

922
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.562
The show, the pressure, the groupies,
the autograph hounds, the crew.

923
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:41.940
The incompetents behind the scenes
you think are your friends...

924
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:45.444
...and you're not sure if you're gonna be there
tomorrow because of them.

925
01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:50.574
Wonderful pressures that make every day
a glowing, radiant day in your life.

926
01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:55.120
It's terrific. Okay.
If all of that means nothing...

927
01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.914
...if I'm wrong, in spite of all that...

928
01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.292
...then I apologize, I'm sorry.

929
01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:06.298
If you accept my apology, I think we should
shake hands and we'll forget the whole thing.

930
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:12.721
I won't press charges. You two could be
in deep trouble, but I will not press charges.

931
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.934
- Ahh, that's easy for you to say, Jerry.
- But I mean it.

932
01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.855
I mean, I'll go to the office
and tell them all it's a gag.

933
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:25.400
They'll understand that.
If I tell them it's a gag, they're gonna buy it.

934
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:29.863
- And then we'll put the tape on and listen...
- Sit down! I said, sit down.

935
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.615
You heard what he said.

936
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:35.285
Yeah, right. All of a sudden with a gun on him,
he wants to be friends?

937
01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:39.206
- What happens when he walks out the door?
- What happens then, Jerry?

938
01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:43.085
- You get to his office, and they jump you.
- Is that what happens, Jerry?

939
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:47.339
Not if I tell them not to. They won't jump you.
No one's gonna jump you.

940
01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:52.177
If I tell them to do something, they do it.
No one's gonna jump you.

941
01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:55.514
Now, that's the truth.
You have to take my word for it.

942
01:13:55.681 --> 01:14:00.018
If you think I'm not telling you the truth,
then don't respond.

943
01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.897
If you think I'm telling you the truth,
then let me get the hell out of here.

944
01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.525
- He gives me his word.
- And what else?

945
01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.193
And what else, Jerry?

946
01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.115
There is nothing else. Just my word.

947
01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:16.243
Isn't my word good enough?

948
01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:21.706
I'm sorry, Jerry.

949
01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:42.144
Suppose we tape him, he doesn't talk,
it gets to be 11:30.

950
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.688
Do we put him on, no matter what?

951
01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:48.942
You can go ahead and tape him. It, uh, won't
hurt anything. You always can erase it.

952
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:52.737
We may learn something from it
and, uh, it'll also buy us time.

953
01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.574
Under no circumstances
will we put this man on the air.

954
01:14:55.741 --> 01:15:00.370
This lunatic is threatening Jerry's life
and you're not gonna put him on the air?

955
01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:05.792
Let's not get too excited. I don't think
you understand. We'll tape at 7.

956
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.921
We won't have to make a decision
about putting him on the air till 11:30.

957
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:15.594
This gives us four hours. Hopefully, by that
time, we'll have Mr. Langford back safely.

958
01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:20.265
Harry, that's it. We're suing. We're going
to sue. We're gonna sue everybody.

959
01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.767
- Who is this man?
- Jerry's lawyer.

960
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:26.563
What do you mean, who am I?
I'm the one who's suing. I'm the lawyer.

961
01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.149
- Jay...
- Don't "Jay" me, please. Do me a favor.

962
01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:31.610
Jay, who are you going to sue?

963
01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.778
You. We're suing you, personally!

964
01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.780
- Who else are you suing?
- The FBI.

965
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.242
We have a serious situation
and I want it dealt with rationally.

966
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:42.913
Unless we start talking politely,
there's gonna be serious consequences.

967
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.293
There is nothing polite about kidnapping.
It is one of the most stupid offenses ever.

968
01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:52.297
Where's the defense of kidnapping?
How can you say "I was crazy"?

969
01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:55.634
"I didn't know what I was doing.
I did it on the spur of the moment"?

970
01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:56.843
Jay, who cares?

971
01:15:57.011 --> 01:16:01.640
Only an idiot kidnaps. And only an idiot
decides to do what you guys are doing.

972
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.777
Jerry, I'm gonna go now.

973
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:19.741
Pretty soon you'll be able to go.
About 12-, 12:30, as I said. Have a good time.

974
01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.285
I know you will, heh.

975
01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:23.870
Bye.

976
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.878
First of all, we don't know whether
we're dealing with kidnappers or terrorists.

977
01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.839
Terrorists? Terrorists?
What do you mean, terrorists?

978
01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:38.468
You might have this man go on the air,
deliver a coded message...

979
01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:41.846
...and possibly 50 people around the country
would lose their lives.

980
01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:45.100
- You're out of your mind!
- I'm not out of my mind.

981
01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:48.395
That guy is gonna be taped,
and we'll listen to what he says.

982
01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.857
Unless something horrendous is on that tape,
we're gonna put that tape on the air.

983
01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:58.530
All we're dealing with here is 10 minutes
of talk-show time against a man's life...

984
01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:00.865
...and I don't see that as any argument.

985
01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:05.412
Hello. How are you today? Well, I'm calling...

986
01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.999
Mr. King calling collect
long distance for Mr. Thomas.

987
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.210
Mr. Thomas, there's a long-distance call.

988
01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.878
Let's go.

989
01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.965
If this is it, remember, keep him talking.

990
01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.509
Uh, hi, there. Who is this?

991
01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:22.304
This is Mr. King. I'm calling for Mr. King.

992
01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.514
Uh-huh. Well, you're right on time.

993
01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:28.351
Yes, of course. We're always punctual.
We're fine, thank you.

994
01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:30.895
I wanna make it brief, and I wanna tell you...

995
01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:34.816
Could I break in and ask you,
could I speak to Jerry?

996
01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.403
No, Jerry's not with us. We're at a payphone.
Don't have the call traced.

997
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:41.740
I noticed you just did. I heard the sounds.
I do know those sounds.

998
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:47.370
It's kind of important, so that we know
that he's in... What'll I say? ...your care?

999
01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:53.251
We've taken care of that by bringing along
an article of clothing that you will recognize.

1000
01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:57.839
It is not as easy as you think just to
walk in the studio, go right on the show...

1001
01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.383
No, Bert... If I could call you, uh...

1002
01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:05.347
Well, if I could just say, there is no problem.
The material is clean material.

1003
01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:09.434
- Do you know of Standards and Practices?
- No, but that can be discussed.

1004
01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:12.604
All I can say is don't have any press leaks.

1005
01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:19.110
You must keep the audience there until 11:45
or 12:00, after it has been aired nationally.

1006
01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:23.948
Thank you. We'll discuss the other things.
That's your problem. Nice talking to you.

1007
01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:31.915
Boy, he's shrewd.
He just, uh, wouldn't buy anything.

1008
01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:32.183
I feel completely impulsive tonight.

1009
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.936
Anything... Anything could happen.

1010
01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.690
I have so much to tell you.
I don't know where to start.

1011
01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:43.236
I wanna tell you everything about myself,
everything you don't know.

1012
01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:49.951
Do you like these glasses?
Crystal. Beautiful. I bought them just for you.

1013
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:53.830
There's something about them.
Just the simplicity of them.

1014
01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:58.168
But if you don't like them, if there's even
an inkling, even a doubt in your mind...

1015
01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.886
Sometimes during the day
I'll just be doing the simplest things.

1016
01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.555
I'll be taking a bath and I'll say to myself:

1017
01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:13.892
"Heh, I wonder
if Jerry's taking a bath right now."

1018
01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.770
And I just hope, you know,
you're not drowning or something, heh.

1019
01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:22.233
I just get really worried about you,
like something terrible's gonna happen.

1020
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:26.404
And I have these daydreams
that I'm out with you at the golf course...

1021
01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:29.699
...driving your cart, just driving around.

1022
01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:34.078
"You need a putter, Jer?" You know?
Heh-heh-heh.

1023
01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.080
"Need an iron?"

1024
01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:41.085
I don't even know how to play golf.
I played with my parents once, my dad, but...

1025
01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.671
I love you.

1026
01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.887
I've never told my parents that I love them.

1027
01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:55.433
They never told me they loved me either,
which was fine with me.

1028
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.602
But I love you.

1029
01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:02.315
Want some wine? No? Okay.

1030
01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:05.109
I'm not in the mood to drink either though.

1031
01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:07.779
But I'm sure in the mood to be alone with you.

1032
01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:13.451
Why don't we just clear off the table?

1033
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.916
I was thinking why don't we go upstairs,
but that's so predictable.

1034
01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:22.961
Let's just take everything off the table
and do it right here.

1035
01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:28.299
That would blow your mind. It would blow
my mind. I've never done anything like that.

1036
01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:31.553
I've never even had anybody over for dinner,
let alone made love on the table.

1037
01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:38.434
But I just wanna do that. I just wanna dance.
I just wanna, like, put on some Shirelles.

1038
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.645
I wanna be black.

1039
01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.857
Wouldn't that be insane?

1040
01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:47.652
God. You know who I wish I was tonight?

1041
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.281
I wish I was Tina Turner,
just dancing through the room.

1042
01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.622
Thank you. Please have your tickets ready.

1043
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:09.465
Good evening.
My name is Clarence McCabe. I'm the writer.

1044
01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:12.176
- Are these people with you?
- Yes. This is my wife.

1045
01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:16.514
- These people here?
- Her parents, from Cleveland, Ohio.

1046
01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.601
- I'll check your name, sir.
- I'm gonna be on third.

1047
01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.811
I'll check your name, sir.

1048
01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:27.817
- I'm sorry, sir. I don't see your name, sir.
- You just went past the M's.

1049
01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.696
I'll go back again for you, sir.
There it is again, sir.

1050
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.949
Let me just check. This isn't possible.

1051
01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:39.037
- Did Miss Long call you?
- No, sir, she didn't.

1052
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:42.206
She didn't tell you about my book
and that I was gonna be on?

1053
01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.835
- Not according to this list.
- She told me to be here at a quarter to 6.

1054
01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:49.130
It's now 10 to 6. I've only got 10 minutes.

1055
01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:53.509
Only authorized personnel are allowed in.
That's the rules and regulations.

1056
01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:58.514
You never heard of the book?
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger?

1057
01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:01.684
- Can I call Miss Long?
- You cannot call Miss Long at all.

1058
01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.686
- Can you call Miss Long?
- No, sir.

1059
01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:08.733
Your name is not on the list, so I cannot
let you in. That's the rules and regulations.

1060
01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.736
- I'm gonna try to get her. Miss Long?
- Stop him.

1061
01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.029
Miss Long?

1062
01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:16.240
McCABE:
Hey, hey. What's going on? Let go of me!

1063
01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.499
Clarence!

1064
01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.335
- Miss Long!
- Clarence?

1065
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:43.559
- What is this Clarence McCabe?
- That's who I am.

1066
01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:47.271
- Is that your real name?
- Well, technically, it's my real name.

1067
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:51.776
- No, it's a pseudonym, actually. An alias.
- Why do you use a pseudonym?

1068
01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.612
- I'm an author. That's my business.
- Author of what?

1069
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.949
I told you. I wrote a book called
The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

1070
01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:01.577
I spent two years in Russia,
two years in China, researching it.

1071
01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.456
- Two years in Russia, two in China?
- Right. Does that make me a Communist now?

1072
01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:17.427
We have one more light to preset.
That'll be number 47.

1073
01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:20.471
- Hello, I'm the King.
- What?

1074
01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:24.475
- The King.
- What can I do for Your Highness?

1075
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.352
Really, I'm the King.

1076
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.232
Your dressing room's backstage. Your throne
is in there also. You'll recognize the door.

1077
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.442
Very funny.

1078
01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.236
- There's a half-moon, stars.
- Is there someone in charge?

1079
01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:40.158
Mr. Ding. He's a little fella with
an ice-cream cone nose, a couple of bells.

1080
01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:41.993
- Miss Long.
- Mr. Pipkin?

1081
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:45.913
No, it's Mr. Pupkin, Miss Long.
Mr. Pupkin. How are you?

1082
01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:49.834
What are you doing here, Mr. Pupkin?

1083
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.711
I'm the King.

1084
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.797
I think you're expecting me.

1085
01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:58.092
- Yeah.
- Yes. Mr. Thomas around?

1086
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.279
You're gonna love me

1087
01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:23.242
Like nobody's loved me

1088
01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:28.289
Come rain or come shine

1089
01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:33.377
Happy together

1090
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:37.256
Unhappy together

1091
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:43.721
And won't it be fine?

1092
01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:52.146
Days may be cloudy or sunny

1093
01:25:54.566 --> 01:26:01.572
We're in and we're out of the money

1094
01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:07.995
I'm with you always

1095
01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.751
I'm with you

1096
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:17.255
Rain

1097
01:26:17.965 --> 01:26:24.971
Or shine

1098
01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:31.102
- Mr. King?
- Yes.

1099
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:32.854
I'm Inspector Gerrity from the FBI.

1100
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.313
- Do you understand?
- Mm-hm.

1101
01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.523
What is your name?

1102
01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.276
- Rupert Pupkin.
- What is your real name?

1103
01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.486
That's my real name. Rupert Pupkin.

1104
01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:45.575
Well, Mr. Pupkin, are you gonna tell us
where Jerry Langford is or not?

1105
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:48.202
- Are you from the show?
- No, I'm not in the show.

1106
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:53.124
This is my assistant, Agent Giardello, and
Captain Burke of the New York City Police.

1107
01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:55.126
I'd like to meet someone from the show.

1108
01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:58.754
You don't get to see anyone with the show
until I get to see Langford.

1109
01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.965
I'd like to see someone from the show first.

1110
01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.968
You won't see someone
unless you tell us where Langford is.

1111
01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.596
Well, then Jerry Langford is dead.

1112
01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.891
Get Thomas.

1113
01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:16.105
- I'm Bert Thomas. Are you Mr. King?
- Yes. How do you do?

1114
01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:19.901
- Uh, did we talk on the phone today?
- Yes, we spoke a few moments ago.

1115
01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.820
- And then Jerry spoke to you earlier.
- Uh...

1116
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:28.659
- Where did you get this?
- That's Jerry's, as you can see.

1117
01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:32.038
- What's that?
- That's my blood, not Jerry's, heh.

1118
01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.665
I'll buy this. What have we here?

1119
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:39.420
This is my introduction, and I'd like
Mr. Randall, if he could, speak it word for word.

1120
01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.090
Randall's introduction to your monologue?
Could I have a copy of your monologue?

1121
01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.300
Uh...

1122
01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:47.678
Actually, I have it memorized,
so I don't have a copy of it.

1123
01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:51.891
There are reasons I need a copy. We have to
make sure you don't say anything obscene...

1124
01:27:52.059 --> 01:27:54.936
...or anything that could cause
a problem in the audience.

1125
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.272
No, it's all right, really.
It's a wholesome monologue.

1126
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.942
- You guarantee it?
- Nothing obscene. I guarantee it.

1127
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.195
Make sure you got that audience
till after 11:30.

1128
01:28:04.363 --> 01:28:08.282
- The man's gonna get everything he asks for.
- Thank you. It's nice meeting you.

1129
01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.534
Sit down, Pupkin.

1130
01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:16.707
Mr. Pupkin, I gotta tell you this. From this
point on, you have the right to remain silent.

1131
01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.376
- You understand?
Mm-hmm.

1132
01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.252
Because anything you say
from here on out...

1133
01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.340
...might be used against you later on
in a court of law. You understand?

1134
01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:27.051
- Say you understand.
- I understand that.

1135
01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:30.721
Did you participate
in the abduction of Jerry Langford?

1136
01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.224
Yes, I did. I abducted him.

1137
01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:36.227
You abducted him?
Do you know where Mr. Langford is now?

1138
01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:37.687
Yes, I do.

1139
01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:41.190
- Will you lead us to Mr. Langford?
- No, I won't.

1140
01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:46.862
At this time, Mr. Pupkin, I want to advise you
to consider yourself under arrest.

1141
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.490
Fine. I think I should get made up.

1142
01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:53.411
You need some make-up.
Put some color on his face.

1143
01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.287
I'd like to put some color on your face.

1144
01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.000
Really, I should get made up.

1145
01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.753
"...sad news for you." Turn the card.
"I have some sad..."

1146
01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:05.464
- Tony, did you wanna see me?
- Have you seen this stuff?

1147
01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.591
I've gone over it. I think it's fine.

1148
01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:12.221
This is fine? "My writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad."

1149
01:29:12.389 --> 01:29:14.432
- I think it's good.
- You're laughing at that?

1150
01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:17.101
- Do me a favor, please.
- Why do I have to say this?

1151
01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:22.273
Exactly as it's written. It'll play for us.
It'll be good for you. Trust me.

1152
01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:26.110
- You're the director. Can you help me?
- Take the tissues out and let's go.

1153
01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:30.406
- A few more minutes. Let's go.
- Turn the cards fast. Are you listening?

1154
01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:31.907
- Turn the cards fast.
- Okay.

1155
01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:36.120
Let's do something crazy tonight.
Just get insane. I wanna be crazy!

1156
01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:39.123
I wanna be nuts!
I wanna have some fun! Goddamn it.

1157
01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:43.210
My doctor says, "Don't have any fun.
No, you're not allowed to have a good time.

1158
01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:45.796
You can't get crazy."
See, I have to be in control.

1159
01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:47.298
And I like being in control.

1160
01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:51.969
But for one night I'd like to see myself
out of my head! Wouldn't you?

1161
01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:54.722
Wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be fabulous?

1162
01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:58.184
I'm having a good time.

1163
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.316
I'm having fun.

1164
01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:08.611
Fun is my middle name. I'm having fun.

1165
01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:14.241
That's right. Having some fun.
Never had this much fun before.

1166
01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:16.243
That's right.

1167
01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:21.832
Good, old-fashioned,
all-American fun.

1168
01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:27.671
And now, direct from New York,
it's The Jerry Langford Show...

1169
01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:31.509
...with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests:

1170
01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:36.013
Shelley Winters, Gore Vidal, Tony Bennett...

1171
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:40.476
...as always, Lou Brown and the orchestra
and little old me, Ed Herlihy.

1172
01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:43.437
For now, say hello to Tony!

1173
01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:04.667
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. I have some sad news for you.

1174
01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:06.293
Aw!

1175
01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:11.632
Earlier today, my writing staff was executed
in Central Park by the network firing squad.

1176
01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:16.846
So there will be no sensational
Randall monologue this evening.

1177
01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.398
No embarrassing display of emotion, please.

1178
01:31:27.566 --> 01:31:31.694
Instead we're going to do something a little bit
different this evening. A lot different.

1179
01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:34.238
We're going to give you a glimpse...
Turn it over, please.

1180
01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.782
Ha-ha-ha.
- into the future.

1181
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:40.911
It isn't often you can call someone
a sure thing in the entertainment business.

1182
01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:44.248
After all, the verdict is always
in your hands, isn't it?

1183
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:47.001
But I think tonight, after you've met...

1184
01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.756
...my first guest...

1185
01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:58.179
...you'll agree with me that he's destined
for greatness, in one way or another.

1186
01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:02.933
So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy...

1187
01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:05.102
...Rupert Pupkin!

1188
01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:23.162
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Let me
introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1189
01:32:27.626 --> 01:32:30.127
I can't believe I'm gonna kiss you.

1190
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.797
Masha.

1191
01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:35.799
Take the tape off.

1192
01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.761
Really?

1193
01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:40.971
Go on. Take it off.

1194
01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:50.314
- I'm ready now.
- Take him back down.

1195
01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.565
With pleasure.

1196
01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:55.736
Why did you do this? Tell me why
and then maybe I'll be able to believe in you.

1197
01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:58.948
- Why did you do such a thing?
- Do you know what time it is?

1198
01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:01.784
- It's five minutes to 11.
- I think we better go.

1199
01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:06.830
Because otherwise... I don't like to say it
like this.... Jerry's gonna be unavailable.

1200
01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:10.376
- You'll understand when we go.
- I'll understand? Why will I understand?

1201
01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:12.211
Where are we going?

1202
01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:16.632
- Well, that's part of the bargain.
- Part of what bargain?

1203
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.761
That's my understanding.
Now, I just want to see it in this other place.

1204
01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.515
And once I see it, that's it.
I'll give you Langford.

1205
01:33:24.683 --> 01:33:26.642
- But you don't understand my position.
- Uh-huh.

1206
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:27.851
I have you right now.

1207
01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.854
- That's true.
- If I have you, I have a shot at Langford.

1208
01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:34.191
- But you don't have Jerry.
- I understand that.

1209
01:33:35.694 --> 01:33:37.861
I'm getting it off as fast as I can.

1210
01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:40.948
- That's good, Masha.
- Yeah?

1211
01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.159
- You all right?
- I'm doing fine.

1212
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:45.911
I know you are.

1213
01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.580
Come on.

1214
01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:58.215
One more thing, please.
I can't walk in here with you. If you could both...

1215
01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:02.094
If you could just wait here
and let me walk in by myself, that's all.

1216
01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:04.722
I'll break your ankles
if you make a wrong move.

1217
01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.725
I promise. I promise, okay?

1218
01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:10.436
But make believe you don't know me too.

1219
01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:11.687
Go ahead.

1220
01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:41.091
Jerry, you seem a little bit...

1221
01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.939
Jerry! Jerry, wait!

1222
01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:58.108
Jerry! Jerry!

1223
01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:01.570
Jerry, come back here!

1224
01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:04.782
Jerry!

1225
01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:11.997
Oh, God.

1226
01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:14.541
What do you want now?

1227
01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:22.049
- What are you doing? I'm watching that.
- Just a minute.

1228
01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:26.387
And now, direct from
New York, it's The Jerry Langford Show...

1229
01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:31.141
...with guest host Tony Randall
and his special guests: Shelley Winters...

1230
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:35.979
- What's going on here?
- Do you know him?

1231
01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:41.235
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Just sit tight. Relax. Everything'll be okay.

1232
01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.281
My first guest, you'll agree with me
that he's destined for greatness...

1233
01:35:46.449 --> 01:35:48.492
...in one way or another.

1234
01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:52.996
So will you please give your warmest
greetings to the newest King of Comedy...

1235
01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.249
...Rupert Pupkin!

1236
01:36:08.054 --> 01:36:11.056
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me introduce myself.

1237
01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:12.850
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

1238
01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:18.230
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey,
which was not at that time a federal offense.

1239
01:36:20.233 --> 01:36:22.484
Is there anyone here from Clifton?

1240
01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.027
Good, we can all relax now.

1241
01:36:25.738 --> 01:36:28.782
Now, I'd like to begin by saying
that my parents were too poor...

1242
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:31.869
...to afford me a childhood in Clifton...

1243
01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:36.039
...but the fact is that no one is allowed
to be really too poor in Clifton.

1244
01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:39.543
Once you fall below a certain level,
they exile you to Passaic.

1245
01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:48.552
But my parents did put the first two
down payments on my childhood.

1246
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.471
Don't get me wrong.

1247
01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:53.390
But they did also return me
to the hospital as defective.

1248
01:36:56.978 --> 01:37:01.398
But like everyone else, I grew up
in large part thanks to my mother.

1249
01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.901
If she were only here today, I'd say:

1250
01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.904
"Hey, Mom! What are you doing here?
You've been dead for nine years!"

1251
01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.786
But seriously, you should've seen my mother.
She was wonderful.

1252
01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:17.831
Blond, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic...

1253
01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.546
We used to drink milk together after school.
Mine was homogenized, hers was loaded.

1254
01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:29.301
Once they picked her up for speeding.
They clocked her doing 50.

1255
01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:30.928
All right, but in our garage?

1256
01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:41.813
And, you know, when they tested her, they
found out that her alcohol had 2 percent blood.

1257
01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:51.281
But we used to joke together, Mom and me...

1258
01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:56.453
...until the tears would stroll down her face
and she would throw up! Yeah.

1259
01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.248
And who would clean it up? Ha, not Dad.

1260
01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:04.169
He was too busy down at O'Grady's,
throwing up on his own. Yeah.

1261
01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:08.423
In fact, until I was 16, I thought
throwing up was a sign of maturity.

1262
01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:13.470
While the other kids were off in the woods
sneaking cigarettes...

1263
01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:16.223
...I was hiding behind the house
with my fingers down my throat.

1264
01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:28.277
The only problem was I never got anywhere,
until one day my father caught me.

1265
01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:32.948
And, you know, just as he was giving me
a final kick in the stomach for luck...

1266
01:38:33.116 --> 01:38:36.577
...I managed to heave all over his new shoes!

1267
01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:40.455
"That's it!" I thought.
"I've made it! I'm finally a man!"

1268
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.133
But, as it turned out, I was wrong.

1269
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:54.177
That was the only attention
my father ever gave me.

1270
01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:55.387
Aw...

1271
01:38:55.555 --> 01:39:00.642
Yeah, he was usually too busy out in the park
playing ball with my sister Rose.

1272
01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.144
Aw...

1273
01:39:02.312 --> 01:39:05.522
But today, I must say,
thanks to those many hours of practice...

1274
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:08.400
...my sister Rose has grown into a fine man.

1275
01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:16.700
Me, I wasn't interested in athletics.

1276
01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:20.829
The only exercise I ever got
was when the other kids picked on me.

1277
01:39:20.997 --> 01:39:23.665
They used to beat me up once a week,
usually Tuesday.

1278
01:39:25.335 --> 01:39:28.045
And after a while,
the school worked it into the curriculum.

1279
01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:32.549
And if you knocked me out,
you got extra credit.

1280
01:39:35.053 --> 01:39:38.055
Except there was this one kid.
Poor kid. He was afraid of me.

1281
01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:41.600
I used to tell him, "Hit me, hit me!
What's the matter with you?

1282
01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.435
Don't you wanna graduate?"

1283
01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:53.654
As for me, hey, I was the youngest kid in the
history of the school to graduate in traction.

1284
01:39:57.659 --> 01:40:02.287
But, you know, my only real interest,
right from the beginning, was show business.

1285
01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:05.874
Even as a young man, I began at the very top,
collecting autographs.

1286
01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.671
Now...

1287
01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:16.426
...a lot of you are probably wondering
why Jerry isn't with us tonight.

1288
01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:19.096
Well, I'll tell you, the fact is he's tied up.

1289
01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:20.430
And I'm the one who tied him.

1290
01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:29.314
I know you think I'm joking, but that's the
only way I could break into show business...

1291
01:40:29.482 --> 01:40:32.192
...by hijacking Jerry Langford.

1292
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.612
Right now Jerry is strapped to a chair
somewhere in the middle of this city.

1293
01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:47.249
Go ahead and laugh. Thank you.
I appreciate it. But the fact is, I'm here.

1294
01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:50.919
Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding
and you'll think I was crazy.

1295
01:40:51.087 --> 01:40:55.298
But, look, I figure it this way: better to be king
for a night than schmuck for a lifetime.

1296
01:40:58.553 --> 01:41:00.762
Thank you. Thank you.

1297
01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:44.848
- How'd you do that?
- Did you like it? Thank you.

1298
01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:49.019
I'd like to buy everyone here a drink,
and I hope you all enjoyed the show.

1299
01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:52.898
- Rita, you keep the change.
- We're getting Langford now.

1300
01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:57.444
Rita, just because I made it big
doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you.

1301
01:41:58.321 --> 01:42:00.822
- Remember, I'll call you...
- No more speeches.

1302
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:02.991
- What's happening here?
- Take care.

1303
01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:08.538
That's the same guy who was just
on television. Just now. Same guy.

1304
01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:14.211
I'm just getting even.
Those jokes... Those jokes were murder.

1305
01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:16.546
- You didn't like those jokes?
- No. No.

1306
01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:22.052
I'm looking for the guy that wrote the material.
I'd like to pick him up and take him along.

1307
01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:27.849
I wrote the material. I disagree with you.
I thought they were very good jokes.

1308
01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:32.687
If you wrote that material,
I got one piece of advice for you.

1309
01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:37.067
Throw yourself on your knees
in front of the judge and beg for mercy.

1310
01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.820
That's very funny, but you'll see.

1311
01:42:40.112 --> 01:42:42.823
In the most bizarre debut in recent times...

1312
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:47.786
...a self-styled comedian named Rupert Pupkin
appeared on The Jerry Langford Show.

1313
01:42:47.954 --> 01:42:49.704
There is no doubt the incident...

1314
01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:51.873
...has made the name Rupert Pupkin
a household word.

1315
01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:54.292
Rupert Pupkin's performance...

1316
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.379
...has been viewed by a record 87 million
American households.

1317
01:42:57.547 --> 01:42:59.965
Rupert Pupkin,
the kidnapping King of Comedy...

1318
01:43:00.132 --> 01:43:02.092
...was sentenced to six years imprisonment...

1319
01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:05.637
...at the minimum-security facility
in Allenwood, Pennsylvania...

1320
01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:09.432
...for his part in the abduction
of talk-show host Jerry Langford.

1321
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.143
On the anniversary
of his appearance on the show...

1322
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:18.149
...Pupkin told reporters he still considers
Jerry Langford his friend and mentor.

1323
01:43:18.317 --> 01:43:21.736
He reported that
he has been writing his memoirs...

1324
01:43:21.904 --> 01:43:25.115
...which have been purchased by
a leading New York publishing house...

1325
01:43:25.283 --> 01:43:26.950
...for in excess of $1 million.

1326
01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.994
Rupert Pupkin was released today...

1327
01:43:29.161 --> 01:43:32.497
...after serving two years and nine months
of a six-year sentence.

1328
01:43:32.665 --> 01:43:35.917
Hundreds were there to greet
the 37-year-old comedian and author...

1329
01:43:36.085 --> 01:43:38.753
...among them his new agent and manager,
David Ball...

1330
01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:42.507
...who announced that King for a Night,
Pupkin's bestselling autobiography...

1331
01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.634
...would appear as a major motion picture.

1332
01:43:44.802 --> 01:43:48.680
Pupkin said he had used his stay
at Allenwood to sharpen his material.

1333
01:43:48.848 --> 01:43:52.267
He said he and his people were weighing
a number of attractive offers...

1334
01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:55.520
...and that he looked forward
to resuming his show-business career.

1335
01:43:57.315 --> 01:44:02.110
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the man we've all been waiting for...

1336
01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:04.321
...and waiting for.

1337
01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:10.493
Would you welcome home, please,
television's brightest new star.

1338
01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:14.789
The legendary, inspirational,
the one and only King of Comedy...

1339
01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:18.585
...ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Pupkin!

1340
01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:36.186
